# Security Modeling

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Explain what a **security model** is and how it differs from informal “security thinking.”  
- Identify **core elements** of a protocol security model: trust boundaries, threat actors, attack surface, and security properties (e.g., confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity) [web:557][web:563].  
- Apply **threat‑modeling‑style methods** (e.g., STRIDE‑style breakdown or data‑flow‑style analysis) to a Flow‑style protocol or multi‑agent system [web:553][web:555].  
- Connect security modeling to **consensus‑economics**, **MLOps**, and **deployment patterns** (e.g., identity, encryption, and access control) in the larger Flow‑style stack.

## Introduction

At the advanced level, you are not just asking “Does this protocol work?” or “Is it fast enough?” You are asking:

> “What can go wrong if adversaries, misconfigured services, or simple accidents try to break it, and how do we build the system so it survives those events?”

This is **security modeling**: a **structured, upfront way** to think about security in protocol design [web:554][web:563].  

In Flow‑style systems, where protocols coordinate governance, learner behavior, and ML‑style rewards, getting this wrong can:

- corrupt decisions,  
- leak sensitive data,  
- or undermine trust in the whole ecosystem.

Good security modeling is **not** bolted on in QA; it is **part of the design process**, just like your state machines and upgrade paths.

## What Is a Security Model?

A **security model** is a **formal or semi‑formal description** of:

- **who is trusted** and under what conditions,  
- **what can fail** and how,  
- and **what security properties** the system must preserve (e.g., confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity) [web:557][web:560].

Loosely, a security model answers:

- Which components are **trusted vs untrusted** (e.g., trusted servers, untrusted network, potentially malicious clients).  
- What **attacks are assumed possible** (e.g., man‑in‑the‑middle, spoofing, tampering, denial of service).  
- What **conditions must hold** for the system to be considered secure (e.g., “no double‑spend,” “no forged governance‑events”).

For Flow‑style protocols, this is especially useful when you design:

- governance‑style multi‑agent layers,  
- cross‑ledger or interchain‑style communication,  
- or ML‑driven data‑flows involving sensitive learner information.

## Core Elements of a Security Model

To build a useful security model, you should make explicit a few core elements [web:557][web:563]:

### 1. Trust Boundaries and Trust Assumptions

- **Trust boundaries** are lines between parts of the system with different levels of trust.

  - For example:

    - between **client** and **trusted backend**,  
    - or between **on‑chain governance** and **off‑chain reward‑engine**.

- **Trust assumptions** describe what you assume:

  - can be compromised,  
  - what cannot,  
  - and under which conditions.

Examples:

- “The network is untrusted; clients are partially untrusted.”  
- “Validators are assumed rational and self‑interested but not assumed always honest.”

Flow‑style motivation:

- clarifying these assumptions helps you decide where to place encryption, signatures, and access controls.

### 2. Threat Actors and Motives

A **threat actor** is any entity that can attack or misuse the system:

- external attacker,  
- malicious validator,  
- compromised client,  
- misconfigured operator, or  
- unusually greedy power user.

For each relevant actor type, ask:

- What **permissions** do they have?  
- What **goals** might they pursue (e.g., disrupt governance, extract sensitive data, grind rewards)?

Then relate those actors to your **consensus‑economics** incentives (from `02‑consensus‑economics.md`).

### 3. Attack Surface

The **attack surface** is the sum of all points where an attacker can interact with the system:

- **network endpoints** (e.g., HTTP APIs, WebSocket feeds),  
- **message formats** (e.g., governance‑events, learner‑data packages),  
- **state‑machine transitions** (e.g., “what happens when a proposal is submitted?”).

Security modeling often proceeds by:

- drawing a **data‑flow diagram** of the protocol,  
- and marking where attacks can occur (e.g., spoofed messages, tampered payloads, replayed events).

### 4. Security Properties

A protocol should clearly state which **security properties** it gives up to and which it must preserve [web:557][web:560]. Common ones:

- **Confidentiality**: data is not revealed to unauthorized parties.  
- **Integrity**: data is not tampered with (e.g., governance‑events are not forged).  
- **Availability**: critical flows stay reachable under expected load and attack.  
- **Authenticity**: we can identify who performed an action (e.g., which learner, which governance body).  
- **Non‑repudiation**: actors cannot deny their actions (e.g., voters cannot later claim “I didn’t vote”).

Flow‑style customization:

- you may not need **military‑style** levels of all four; instead, you can **prioritize** based on the flow:

  - governance‑voting may care about **integrity** and **authenticity**,  
  - while learner‑data flows may care more about **confidentiality** and **availability**.

---

## Applying Threat‑Modeling‑Style Analysis

Security modeling is closely related to **threat modeling**, a technique that helps you systematically examine how attackers can compromise a system before implementation [web:553][web:555].

A practical, Flow‑style‑compatible way to do it:

### 1. Identify Assets and Data Flows

- List the **assets** you care about:

  - governance‑state,  
  - learner‑profiles,  
  - reward‑calculations,  
  - or ML‑training data.

- Sketch **data‑flow diagrams** between components and actors:

  - who sends what, to whom, under what conditions.

### 2. Apply a Simple STRIDE‑Style Filter

One widely used framework is **STRIDE**, which prompts you to think about:

- **Spoofing**: can an attacker impersonate a client, validator, or governance body?  
- **Tampering**: can messages or state be modified in transit or at rest?  
- **Repudiation**: can a participant deny sending a message or taking an action?  
- **Information disclosure**: can sensitive data leak via logs, errors, or side‑channels?  
- **Denial of service**: can an attacker exhaust resources or stall critical flows?  
- **Elevation of privilege**: can a low‑privilege actor gain higher‑privilege access?

For each flow in your diagram:

- ask which of these threats apply,  
- and whether existing or planned controls stop them.

Flow‑style benefit:

- this discipline exposes risks you might otherwise miss in “happy‑path” design documents.

### 3. Map Controls to Threats

Once you know plausible threats, map them to **controls**:

- **Cryptographic**: signatures, MACs, or proofs for integrity and authenticity.  
- **Access‑control**: roles, permissions, and policy‑based gates.  
- **Architectural**: isolation, sandboxing, or narrowing trust surfaces.  
- **Operational**: logging, monitoring, alerting on suspicious patterns.

For Flow‑style protocols:

- these controls usually sit in the **protocol‑style layer**, the **identity‑style layer**, and the **deployment‑style configuration**.

### 4. Iterate and Refine

- Treat the security model as **living documentation**:

  - update it when you redesign the protocol,  
  - when you add new flows,  
  - or when you learn from real‑world incidents.

- Use it in **architecture reviews**, **code reviews**, and **penetration‑test‑style exercises**.

## Connecting Security Modeling to Flow‑Style Systems

Flow‑style protocols often combine:

- **governance‑style** and **reward‑style** coordination,  
- with **ML‑style data‑flows** and **multiple trust domains**.

Security‑modeling disciplines help you:

- De‑risk interchain‑style or multi‑ledger designs by making explicit:

  - which chains or services are trusted,  
  - how cross‑ledger messages are authenticated,  
  - and what trust the destination places in the source.

- Protect learner‑data and ML‑style features by:

  - modeling where data leaves clients,  
  - how it is stored,  
  - and how access is controlled.

- Align with your **consensus‑economics** and **resilience‑style patterns**:

  - if you have strong **incentives and penalties** for validators,  
  - you can reduce the **trust you place in their honesty** and rely more on **cryptographic proofs and audit trails**.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Sketch a Security Model for a Flow‑Style Flow

Take one Flow‑style flow you designed (e.g., governance‑proposal approval or learner‑reward‑distribution):

- Sketch:

  - trust boundaries (trusted vs untrusted components),  
  - key assets,  
  - and main attack‑surface points.

Write it as a short text and, optionally, a small diagram.

### Exercise 2: Run a Mini‑STRIDE Pass

- For the same flow:

  - walk through each data‑flow and ask:  
    `Can this be spoofed? Tampered? Can it be abused for DoS?`  
- For each identified threat:

  - propose at least one control (e.g., signature, rate‑limit, role‑based access).

This is a lightweight way to practice **threat‑modeling on real Flow‑style protocols**.

### Exercise 3: Align with Consensus Economics

- Take a Flow‑style protocol that uses multi‑agent coordination:

  - sketch where cryptographic security (e.g., signatures, proofs) and where **incentive‑style security** (e.g., slashing, reputation‑loss) complement each other.

This trains you to see security as a **hybrid of technical and economic mechanisms**.

## Self‑Assessment

Rate yourself from 1 to 5:

- I can explain what a security model is and how it differs from informal “security thinking.”  
- I can identify core elements: trust boundaries, threat actors, attack surface, and security properties.  
- I can apply a simple STRIDE‑style or data‑flow‑style analysis to a Flow‑style protocol.  
- I can connect security modeling to consensus‑economics, MLOps, and deployment‑pattern decisions.

Action item: write a short note in your lab repo describing the security model you sketched for one Flow‑style flow, and how you would enforce confidentiality, integrity, and availability there.

## Next Steps

- Read `04‑formal‑modeling‑and‑verification.md` next to see how to move from semi‑formal security‑modeling to light‑style formal‑method‑style checks.  
- Treat every new Flow‑style protocol layer as something that must have an **explicit security model**, even if brief.  
- When you design a protocol, start by asking: “What are the trust boundaries, assets, and security properties, and how will we defend against the main threats identified by a STRIDE‑style pass?”

*This lesson gives Flow Initiative trainees an advanced‑level understanding of security modeling in protocol‑style systems, focusing on trust boundaries, threat actors, attack surface, and security properties, and how to apply threat‑modeling‑style analysis (e.g., STRIDE) to Flow‑style governance‑style and ML‑driven protocols to expose and mitigate risks early in the design process.*
