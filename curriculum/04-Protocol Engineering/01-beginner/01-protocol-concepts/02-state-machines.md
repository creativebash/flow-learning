# State Machines

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Explain what a **state machine** is and why it is useful for specifying protocols.  
- Define the core components: **states, transitions, events, and actions** [web:353][web:365].  
- Draw a simple **state diagram** for a small protocol‑like system (e.g., on‑ramp flow, request–response, governance vote).  
- Connect state‑machines to **smart‑contract‑like** and **distributed** systems in Flow‑style contexts [web:358][web:361].

## Introduction

In **protocol engineering**, you often need to describe **how a system behaves over time** under different inputs.  

A **state machine** is one of the cleanest ways to model this:

- It tracks a **current state** of the system and defines rules for **how that state changes** when events or messages arrive [web:354][web:365].

For Flow‑style systems, this is especially useful for:

- governance‑workflow protocols,  
- on‑boarding flows,  
- or any stateful interaction between actors.

This lesson gives you a **working, intuitive** understanding of state machines so you can start using them to pin down protocol rules.

## What Is a State Machine?

A **finite state machine (FSM)** is a model of a system that:

- lives in one of a **finite number of states** at any time.  
- reacts to **events or inputs** by:

  - changing its state, and  
  - optionally running some **actions** (e.g., logging, sending a message, updating a field) [web:353][web:365].

Informally, you can think of a state machine like a **state‑based script**:

- There is a **current state** (e.g., `WAITING`, `PENDING`, `APPROVED`).  
- An **input arrives** (e.g., a user submits a form, an approval arrives).  
- The machine decides: “from this state, given this input, move to a new state and do X.”

### Key Terms

- **State**: a condition the system is in (e.g., `IDLE`, `PENDING_APPROVAL`, `APPROVED`).  
- **Transition**: a move from one state to another triggered by an event.  
- **Event/Trigger**: an input that causes a transition (e.g., `submit_request`, `approve`, `reject`).  
- **Action**: something that happens during or after a transition (e.g., send notification, emit log, update score).

These are the building blocks you will use when you design protocol rules.

---

## Why State Machines Matter for Protocols

Protocols are often defined as **state‑transition rules**:

- “What state can the system be in?”  
- “What inputs can arrive?”  
- “How should the state change when each input arrives?”

Examples of systems that are naturally viewed as state machines:

- **Web protocols** (e.g., HTTP‑style request–response flows, TLS handshake).  
- **Smart contracts** and **blockchain‑style ledgers**, where the chain state evolves via transactions [web:358][web:361].  
- **IoT / device control systems**, where devices move between states like `OFF`, `STANDBY`, `RUNNING`, `FAULT` [web:360][web:363].

In Flow‑style thinking:

- a **state machine** is a **formal sketch** of your protocol’s behavior.  
- once you specify it clearly, you can:

  - implement it in code,  
  - document it for other engineers,  
  - and even use it to reason about correctness and safety.

## Core Components in Detail

### 1. States

A **state** is a named condition of the system. For example, in a governance‑proposal flow:

- `DRAFT`  
- `UNDER_REVIEW`  
- `APPROVED`  
- `REJECTED`  
- `EXECUTED`

At any point in time, a proposal should be in **exactly one of these states** (or a small set of them, if you allow composite states).

### 2. Transitions

A **transition** is a rule like:

- “If the system is in state `UNDER_REVIEW` and event `approve` arrives, move to state `APPROVED` and, optionally, run action `notify_admin`.”

Transitions are usually:

- **triggered by events**,  
- sometimes **guarded** by conditions (e.g., only if `user_role == 'admin'`).

This is how you encode **valid behavior** in a protocol.

### 3. Events and Inputs

**Events** or **inputs** are the “things that happen” that can change state:

- User submits a form.  
- A node receives a message.  
- An approval or rejection event is received.

In practice, you can think of events as:

- explicit messages,  
- or method calls that the protocol accepts.

### 4. Actions

**Actions** are what the system does during a transition:

- updating a field in a database,  
- emitting an event into a log or message bus,  
- sending a webhook or email.

Actions keep the protocol not only **state‑correct** but also **observable and useful**.

## Simple State Diagram Example

A **state diagram** is a picture of your state machine. It helps you and your team see the protocol at a glance.

### Example: Governance Proposal Flow

States:

- `DRAFT`  
- `UNDER_REVIEW`  
- `APPROVED`  
- `REJECTED`  
- `EXECUTED`

Key transitions (sketch):

- `DRAFT` → `UNDER_REVIEW` on event `submit`.  
- `UNDER_REVIEW` → `APPROVED` on event `approve`.  
- `UNDER_REVIEW` → `REJECTED` on event `reject`.  
- `APPROVED` → `EXECUTED` on event `execute`.

In a diagram, this looks like a set of bubbles (states) with arrows (transitions) labeled by events.

Even if you don’t draw it in code, sketching this kind of diagram is a powerful way to **pin down protocol rules**.

---

## State Machines in Code (Concepts)

You do not need a heavyweight framework to start. At the core, a state machine in code usually has:

- A **current state variable** (e.g., `state: str`).  
- A **set of transition rules** (e.g., a table or a switch‑style structure) that maps:

  - `(current_state, event)` → `(next_state, action)`.

In many languages, this can be written as:

- a `match` or `switch` over the current state,  
- with cases that check the event type and decide the next state and what to do.

More advanced patterns (e.g., state‑pattern in OOP, or dedicated FSM libraries) build on this idea but keep the same conceptual structure [web:352][web:362].

---

## How This Fits Into Flow‑Style Systems

### 1. Governance‑Style Protocols

For governance‑style flows:

- each **proposal** can be modeled as a state machine.  
- protocol rules define:

  - who can trigger events,  
  - what states are allowed, and  
  - what transitions are valid.

This makes it easy to audit:

- “Is this proposal in a valid state?”  
- “Was this transition allowed?”

### 2. Smart‑Contract‑Like Systems

Smart contracts are essentially **state machines on the blockchain**:

- the contract has internal state (e.g., balances, flags).  
- transactions are inputs that trigger state transitions [web:358][web:361].  
- the blockchain itself is a **global state machine** that evolves via transactions.

In Flow‑style thinking, you can design your **on‑chain logic** as a small state machine and then:

- verify it mentally or with tests,  
- and keep it as simple as possible.

### 3. Distributed Systems

In distributed‑style architectures (e.g., replicated state machines, IoT control), state machines are used to:

- define **consistent state transitions** across nodes,  
- and to recover from failures by replaying inputs [web:360][web:366].

This is another way protocol‑style thinking converges with distributed‑system design.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Draw a State Diagram

Pick a Flow‑style workflow (e.g., learner on‑ramp, governance‑proposal, or reward‑application):

- List all meaningful **states** the system can be in.  
- List all meaningful **events** that can arrive (e.g., `submit`, `approve`, `reject`, `execute`).  
- Sketch a simple state diagram (boxes + arrows) showing which transitions are allowed.

You can do this on paper or in a simple diagramming tool and add it to your lab repo.

### Exercise 2: Write a Simple FSM in Pseudocode

Using the same workflow:

- Implement a tiny state‑machine class or function in pseudocode (or your preferred language, keeping it minimal):

  - store `current_state`.  
  - define a `handle_event(event_name)` function that maps `(current_state, event_name)` to a next state and an optional action.  

This trains you to move from diagrams to actual code that enforces protocol rules.

### Exercise 3: Spot Invalid Transitions

Take your state diagram and ask:

- Are there transitions that **should never happen** (e.g., from `EXECUTED` back to `UNDER_REVIEW`)?  
- How would you write a test or assertion that prevents those transitions in code?

This is how you start **enforcing** protocol rules, not just describing them.

## Self‑Assessment

Rate yourself from 1 to 5:

- I can explain what a state machine is and why it is useful.  
- I can define states, transitions, events, and actions clearly.  
- I can draw a simple state diagram for a Flow‑style workflow.  
- I can see how state machines relate to smart‑contract‑like and distributed systems.

Action item: write a short note in your lab repo describing one Flow‑style workflow you modeled as a state machine and how that improved your understanding of the protocol rules.

## Next Steps

- Read `03-protocol-specification.md` next to learn how to write **text‑plus‑diagram** specifications for your protocols.  
- Use state machines as your **default mental model** for any protocol that evolves over time.  
- Keep them small and focused; a simple state machine is easier to verify, document, and maintain than a sprawling blob of logic.
