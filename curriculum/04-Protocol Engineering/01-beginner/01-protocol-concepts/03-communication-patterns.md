# Communication Patterns

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Recognize several common **communication patterns** in distributed systems and protocols.  
- Identify when to use **request–response**, **publish–subscribe**, and **message‑queue**‑style patterns.  
- Sketch how these patterns fit into Flow‑style protocols (e.g., governance events, ML‑driven alerts, or on‑ramp flows).  
- Decide, at a high level, which pattern is right for a given Flow‑style interaction.

## Introduction

So far you have learned:

- the difference between **protocol** and **application**,  
- and how to model behavior over time with **state machines**.

Now it is time to look at **how messages move** between components:

- who sends what,  
- who receives what,  
- and when.

These are **communication patterns**. They are not protocols by themselves, but they shape how protocols are structured [web:372][web:380].

In Flow‑style systems, choosing the right pattern affects:

- responsiveness,  
- coupling,  
- and scalability.

## What Are Communication Patterns?

A **communication pattern** is a **reusable way** that components exchange messages in a system [web:372][web:380].

Patterns impose structure on questions like:

- Is the sender **blocked** while waiting for a reply?  
- Does the sender know its **exact receiver(s)**?  
- Is communication **synchronous** or **asynchronous**?

By picking a pattern up front, you avoid inventing a new ad‑hoc scheme for every interaction.

## Key Communication Patterns

### 1. Request–Response

**Request–response** (also called **pull**) is the most familiar pattern [web:378][web:384]:

- A **client** sends a **request** to a **server**.  
- The **server** processes the request and sends back a **response**.  
- The client usually **waits** until it receives the response.

Examples:

- HTTP requests and responses.  
- API calls to a model‑serving endpoint.  
- queries to a governance‑state or learner‑profile service.

**When to use request–response:**

- When you need **immediate answers** and it is okay to block while waiting.  
- When interactions are **point‑to‑point** (one sender talks to one known receiver).

In Flow‑style systems, this is natural for:

- dashboards asking for updated state,  
- or for on‑ramp forms that must immediately validate.

### 2. Publish–Subscribe (Pub/Sub)

**Publish–subscribe** (pub/sub) is a pattern where:

- **Publishers** send messages to **channels** or **topics** without knowing who will receive them.  
- **Subscribers** express interest in certain topics and receive messages that match [web:371][web:377].

No one component has to know all the others; they just know the **topic** semantics.

Key properties:

- **Decoupled**: publishers and subscribers do not need to know each other.  
- **Asynchronous**: the sender does not wait for everyone to receive the message.  
- **Many‑to‑many**: one event can reach many listeners.

Examples:

- Event‑driven systems (e.g., “proposal‑created”, “vote‑received”, “reward‑processed”).  
- Notification systems (e.g., “new learning path available”, “governance‑event scheduled”).

**When to use pub/sub in Flow‑style contexts:**

- You want **event‑driven workflows** (e.g., governance‑events, ML‑driven alerts).  
- You want to avoid hard‑coded dependencies between components (e.g., dashboard, analytics, rewards, and governance services).

---

### 3. Message Queues (Point‑to‑Point)

**Message queues** (also called **point‑to‑point** or **queue‑style**) are:

- A **producer** sends a message to a **queue**.  
- A **consumer** (or set of consumers) reads and processes messages from that queue, often in order [web:372][web:380].

Unlike pub/sub, a queue usually:

- targets **one or a small group** of consumers,  
- may ensure **at‑least‑once** or **exactly‑once** delivery.

Key properties:

- **Decoupled in time**: the producer can send messages even if the consumer is offline.  
- **Ordered and buffered**: the queue can smooth out bursts of work.

Examples:

- Task queues (e.g., “process this governance‑proposal”, “compute this reward‑batch”).  
- Background jobs (e.g., re‑score learners, aggregate activity logs).

**When to use message queues:**

- You have **asynchronous work** that should not block the user.  
- You want to **balance load** over time (e.g., ML‑based scoring, bulk computations).

---

### 4. Other Common Patterns (High‑Level View)

Several other patterns appear in protocol and distributed‑system design [web:372][web:380]:

- **Event‑driven**: components react to **events** from other parts of the system (often layered on top of pub/sub or queues).  
- **Broadcast/multicast**: one sender sends to **many receivers** simultaneously (sometimes used in IoT or real‑time dashboards).  
- **Push / pull streaming**: systems that continuously stream data (e.g., WebSockets, Kafka‑style topics).

You don’t need to dive deep into all of these now; the key is to **recognize** them when you see them and know that they are **patterns**, not random ad‑hoc designs.

## Choosing a Pattern for Your Flow‑Style Protocol

To decide which communication pattern to use, ask:

### 1. Do you need an immediate answer?

- Yes → lean toward **request–response**.  
- No → lean toward **pub/sub** or **message queues**.

### 2. Do you know your receivers?

- Yes (specific, known services) → **request–response** or **message queues**.  
- No (many unknown services may care) → **pub/sub**.

### 3. Do you want decoupling and async?

- Yes → **pub/sub** or **message queues**.  
- No (simple client–server interaction) → **request–response**.

In Flow‑style thinking, a typical setup combines:

- **request–response** for user‑facing APIs (e.g., dashboard queries).  
- **pub/sub** (or event streams) for **protocol‑level events** (e.g., governance‑state changes, learner‑activity events).  
- **message queues** for **background work** (e.g., re‑scoring, batch processing).

This allows you to keep **core protocols** simple and let **applications** opt in to what they care about.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Identify Patterns in Existing Systems

Pick two real‑world systems you know (e.g., a web app, a learning platform, or a governance‑tool):

- For each, identify at least one **request–response** interaction.  
- Identify at least one **pub/sub** or **event‑driven** interaction (even if you only infer it).  
- Write a short note explaining why each pattern fits that use‑case.

This trains you to see patterns instead of “just HTTP.”

### Exercise 2: Sketch a Flow‑Style Event‑Driven Flow

Design a small Flow‑style workflow (e.g., governance‑proposal approval):

- Decide which parts should use **request–response** (e.g., user submits a proposal).  
- Decide which parts should use **pub/sub** (e.g., “proposal‑submitted” event that triggers notifications, analytics, and governance‑dashboard updates).  
- Decide which parts should use **message queues** (e.g., async scoring or reward‑calculation).

Sketch this as a simple diagram or list of steps annotated with patterns.

### Exercise 3: Refactor a Design

Take a design you previously wrote as a plain request–response API:

- Imagine replacing some of its synchronous calls with **events** and **queues**.  
- Write a short note describing what would change and how this affects coupling and observability.

This helps you move from “everything is an immediate API call” to **pattern‑aware** design.

## Self‑Assessment

Rate yourself from 1 to 5:

- I can explain request–response, pub/sub, and message queues at a high level.  
- I can say when each pattern is appropriate for a given interaction.  
- I can sketch which pattern to use for Flow‑style use‑cases like governance‑events or ML‑driven alerts.  
- I can see how communication patterns sit under protocol design.

Action item: write a short note in your lab repo describing one Flow‑style interaction you reframed using a better communication pattern and why that improved the design.

## Next Steps

- Read `04-protocol-specification.md` next to learn how to write **text‑plus‑diagram** spec for protocols that use these communication patterns.  
- Treat communication patterns as **first‑class design choices**, not implementation details.  
- When you design a protocol, start by asking: “What pattern will we use for this interaction?”
