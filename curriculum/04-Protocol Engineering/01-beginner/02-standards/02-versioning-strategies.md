# Versioning Strategies

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Explain why **versioning** is critical for evolving protocols and APIs.  
- Describe common **versioning schemes** (e.g., semantic versioning, URIs, headers).  
- Classify **breaking vs non‑breaking changes** and how they affect version numbers.  
- Choose a versioning strategy for a Flow‑style protocol or API.

## Introduction

In protocol work, you rarely “freeze” a design forever.  
New features, bug fixes, and security updates inevitably change how systems talk to each other [web:400][web:412].

**Versioning** is the practice of:

- tagging each released form of a protocol or API with a **version identifier**,  
- and using that tag to control **breaking** versus **non‑breaking** evolution [web:404][web:414].

In Flow‑style systems, versioning keeps:

- different implementations (e.g., clients, dashboards, governance tools)  
- able to **interoperate** even as the protocol changes over time.

---

## Why Versioning Matters

Without versioning, a small change in a protocol can:

- break existing clients,  
- confuse users,  
- or create multiple “local forks” of the same protocol in practice.

Versioning gives you:

- **clear boundaries** between different eras of a protocol,  
- **upgrade paths** for implementers,  
- and a way to **support multiple versions** while evolving forward.

In Flow‑style thinking:

- a protocol is a **shared contract** between actors.  
- **versioning** is how you manage that contract over time without losing trust.

---

## Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

The most widely used scheme is **semantic versioning**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` [web:405][web:414].

Given a version string `1.2.3`:

- **MAJOR** (1): increment when you make **incompatible API or protocol changes**.  
- **MINOR** (2): increment when you add **new features** in a **backward‑compatible** way.  
- **PATCH** (3): increment when you make **backward‑compatible bug fixes** [web:408][web:411].

For example:

- `1.2.3` → `1.2.4`: small bug‑fix; no breaking changes.  
- `1.2.4` → `1.3.0`: added new features; existing clients still work.  
- `1.3.0` → `2.0.0`: incompatible changes (e.g., removed fields, changed semantics).

In Flow‑style systems:

- use SemVer for **public contracts** (e.g., protocol APIs, event schemas).  
- treat `MAJOR` bumps as **migration events** that require planning and communication.

---

## Common Versioning Patterns for APIs and Protocols

### 1. URI‑Versioning

- Encode the version in the **URL path**:

  - `/api/v1/users`  
  - `/api/v2/users`  

This pattern is:

- highly visible to users and tools,  
- and easy to cache and route, since each version has its own URI [web:403][web:407].

It works well for **public APIs** but can create many URLs to manage.

Flow‑style twist:

- each major protocol revision (e.g., governance‑state machine changes) can live under a new `/vN/...` path.

### 2. Header‑Based Versioning

- Pass the version in an HTTP header, such as:

  - `Accept: application/vnd.myapi.v1+json`  

This keeps the **URI clean** and moves the versioning decision to the client headers [web:403][web:410].

Pros:

- less noise in the URL.  
Cons:

- harder to see which version is being used just from the URL, and less cache‑friendly.

Flow‑style twist:

- useful when you want **one endpoint** but **multiple protocol variants** behind it.

### 3. Query‑Parameter Versioning

- Put the version in a query string:

  - `/api/users?version=2`  

This is flexible but:

- less REST‑like,  
- and can create caching and bookmarking issues [web:403][web:407].

Use this sparingly, and prefer **URI** or **header**‑based schemes for public protocols.

## Versioning in Protocol Design

Protocols need versioning just like APIs:

- **Message formats** must change gracefully.  
- **State‑machine transitions** may be added or removed.  
- **event schemas** evolve over time.

Good practices for protocol versioning include:

- Define a **version field** in key messages or in the handshake (e.g., `protocol_version: 1` in an initial message).  
- Use **semantic versioning semantics**: clearly document what counts as a breaking change for the protocol.  
- Support **multiple versions** for a transition window, then **deprecate** and **retire** older ones [web:401][web:412].

In Flow‑style systems:

- a protocol version can correspond to:

  - a **state‑machine definition**,  
  - a **schema for events or proposals**,  
  - and a **set of invariants** enforced by validators or nodes.

---

## Breaking vs Non‑Breaking Changes

A key idea in versioning is to classify changes:

### 1. Breaking Changes

A **breaking change** is one that:

- existing clients or validators **cannot handle** without modification.

Examples:

- Removing or renaming required fields in requests or events.  
- Changing the **meaning** of a field (e.g., `score` used to be 0–100, now 0–1).  
- Removing a state or transition that clients relied on.

These should trigger a **MAJOR** version bump under SemVer and careful migration planning [web:405][web:414].

### 2. Non‑Breaking Changes

A **non‑breaking change** keeps existing clients working “as‑is.”

Examples:

- Adding optional fields.  
- Adding new endpoints or events that old clients simply ignore.  
- Fixing bugs in behavior that did not affect the contract.

These can usually be handled with **MINOR** or **PATCH** bumps.

In Flow‑style practice:

- the **spec** (from `01‑specification‑writing.md`) should classify which changes are breaking and which are not.

---

## How to Use Versioning in Flow‑Style Work

### 1. Plan Versioning Early

- Decide on a **versioning scheme** (e.g., SemVer + URI‑based) **before** you publish the first protocol version.  
- Document how you will **label** and **communicate** new versions.

This avoids painful retrofits later.

### 2. Communicate and Deprecate Clearly

- Publish **changelogs** that explain:

  - what changed,  
  - whether it is breaking,  
  - and what clients must do.

- Give users **time to migrate** before retiring an old version.

Clear communication is part of **trust‑engineering**.

### 3. Keep Contract Versioning Separate from Implementation Versioning

- An internal **implementation** (e.g., rewriting a service from Python to Rust) should not force a **protocol version bump** if the **contract** does not change [web:401].  
- Separate implementation releases from **contract** releases.

This keeps clients from needing to constantly update for non‑breaking internal changes.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Version a Small Flow‑Style Protocol

Take a protocol you defined in `01‑specification‑writing.md`:

- Assign it an initial version (e.g., `1.0.0`).  
- Make a **small change** (e.g., add a new optional field or event) and decide whether it should be a `PATCH`, `MINOR`, or `MAJOR` change.  
- Write a short note explaining your reasoning.

### Exercise 2: Choose a Versioning Pattern for an API

Design a small API that exposes your protocol (e.g., `/governance/v1/proposals`):

- Decide whether you will use URI, header, or query‑parameter versioning.  
- Write a short note explaining why that pattern suits your Flow‑style context.

### Exercise 3: Plan a Migration from v1 to v2

Imagine your protocol needs a **breaking** change:

- Rename a key field, or add a new state that changes the governance‑flow.  
- Sketch a **migration plan**:

  - which version you keep live during transition,  
  - how clients will be notified,  
  - and how long old clients can still work.

This trains you to think in **time‑boxed transitions**, not just “big‑bang” upgrades.

## Self‑Assessment

Rate yourself from 1 to 5:

- I can explain why versioning is important for protocols and APIs.  
- I can describe semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) and what each part means.  
- I can recognize breaking vs non‑breaking changes.  
- I can choose a versioning pattern for a Flow‑style protocol or API.

Action item: write a short note in your lab repo describing how you versioned a Flow‑style protocol and how you would handle a future breaking change.

## Next Steps

- Read `03-protocol-lifecycle-and-governance.md` next to see how versioning connects to **deprecation, migration, and policy** over time.  
- Treat versioning as **part of your protocol contract**, not an afterthought.  
- When you release a Flow‑style protocol, include a **version**, clear **changelog**, and known **deprecation** schedule.
