# Specification Writing

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Explain why a **clear written specification** is essential for protocol design.  
- Identify the **core sections** of a protocol or system specification (e.g., scope, behavior, constraints, diagrams).  
- Write **simple, testable “shall”‑style requirements** without vague language.  
- Use diagrams (state machines, data‑flow sketches) to complement text in your spec.  

## Introduction

You already know how to:

- distinguish **protocol vs application**,  
- model behavior with **state machines**, and  
- structure **communication patterns**.

Now it is time to **document** those ideas in a way that:

- other engineers can understand,  
- stakeholders can review, and  
- the future‑you can read without guessing.

A **specification** (often called a “spec”) is a **written description** of what a system or protocol **must do**, not just what it *might* do [web:389][web:394].

In Flow‑style work, good specs help you:

- align teams,  
- avoid mis‑implementations, and  
- keep protocols **reusable and maintainable**.

## What Is a Specification?

A **specification** is a document that describes:

- **what** a system or protocol should do,  
- **how** it behaves in key scenarios, and  
- **what constraints** it must satisfy (e.g., performance, safety, security).

For protocols, a spec usually answers:

- Who are the **actors** (clients, servers, nodes, voters, etc.)?  
- What **messages** can they exchange?  
- What **state** can the system be in?  
- What **invariants or guarantees** hold (e.g., “no double‑spend”)?

A good spec is:

- **clear**: written in simple, precise language.  
- **complete enough**: enough to build from, but not overly detailed.  
- **testable**: each requirement can, at least in principle, be checked or tested.

This is the “paper‑design” stage before you drop into code.

## Why Specs Matter for Protocols

Protocols are often **shared** across many implementations and teams.  
Without a written spec:

- everyone has a slightly different mental model.  
- small differences in interpretation lead to **interoperability bugs**.

For example:

- the IETF and similar standards bodies insist on **detailed protocol specs** because they expect **many independent implementations** to talk to each other [web:389][web:392].  

In Flow‑style thinking:

- writing a spec is an **engineering discipline**, not “extra documentation.”  
- it reduces churn, mis‑alignment, and re‑design later.

---

## Core Sections of a Protocol Spec

You do not need every section to be huge; just make sure each one is present and clear.

### 1. Title, Metadata, and Scope

- **Title** and **short description** of the protocol.  
- **Authors / maintainers** and contact.  
- **Audience**: who is this spec for? (engineers, PMs, governance bodies?)  
- **Scope**: what is in‑scope and what is not‑scope.

The “scope” is especially important because it:

- stops people from over‑designing the protocol,  
- and keeps the spec focused on the core behavior.

### 2. Terminology and Definitions

- Define **special terms** used in the protocol, even if they seem obvious.  
- Point to **external standards** when you rely on them (e.g., “we use the definitions from RFC 2119 for `MUST`, `SHOULD`, `MAY`” [web:387]).

This avoids confusion like:

- Does “user” mean “learner” or “admin”?  
- What does “valid proposal” actually mean?

### 3. Actors and Roles

Describe:

- **Who the actors are** (e.g., learner, mentor, validator, dashboard, governance‑body).  
- **What each role is allowed to do** (e.g., “only governance‑body can approve a proposal”).

This is part of **security and policy** design, not just naming.

### 4. Behavior and State

Here you combine:

- **State machine** ideas (from `02‑state‑machines.md`).  
- **Key messages or events** (from `03‑communication‑patterns.md`).

Structure this section around:

- **Core states** of the protocol (e.g., `DRAFT`, `UNDER_REVIEW`, `APPROVED`).  
- **Transitions** between states (e.g., when event `approve` arrives, move from `UNDER_REVIEW` to `APPROVED`).  
- **Message formats** (e.g., JSON‑style shapes for requests, events, or transactions).

You can write:

- a **state‑transition table**,  
- or short **scenarios** (e.g., “happy‑path proposal flow” and “rejection flow”).

### 5. Requirements and Constraints

Turn behavior into **requirements**.

A common pattern is to use **“shall” language** to make specs testable [web:391][web:399]:

- “The system **shall** persist the proposal when it transitions from `DRAFT` to `UNDER_REVIEW`.”  
- “The system **shall not** allow a proposal in state `EXECUTED` to be moved back to `UNDER_REVIEW`.”

Other constraints you may include:

- **Performance**: latency, throughput, or load bounds.  
- **Security**: e.g., “only authenticated users may submit proposals.”  
- **Availability / durability**: how the system behaves under failures or restarts.

### 6. Data Formats and APIs

For protocol‑style systems, you often want to pin down:

- **Data formats** (e.g., fields in a proposal, fields in a vote or reward).  
- **APIs or message endpoints** (e.g., HTTP‑style endpoints or event‑schema) [web:397].

Even if you are not writing an RFC‑style spec, sketching these as:

- JSON‑style examples,  
- or pseudocode type‑signatures,  

helps prevent ambiguity when others implement clients or services.

### 7. Examples and Diagrams

- Include **example flows** (e.g., “submit → review → approve → execute”).  
- Add **diagrams**:

  - a **state‑machine diagram**,  
  - a **simple data‑flow** between actors.

Diagrams are not “nice‑to‑have”; they are **part of the spec** and often prevent misunderstandings faster than pages of text.

## Good Writing Habits for Specs

### 1. Be Precise, Not Vague

Avoid:

- “the system should handle proposals quickly”  
- “users might be able to approve proposals.”

Instead:

- “The system **shall** persist the proposal within 2 seconds of receiving a valid `submit` request.”  
- “Only users with role `governance_admin` **shall** be allowed to send an `approve` event.”

Precision makes it possible to **verify** and **test** the spec.

### 2. Use “Shall”, “Must”, “Should”, and “May”

Standards like RFC 2119 define:

- **MUST / SHALL** = this is required.  
- **SHOULD** = strongly recommended but there can be rare exceptions.  
- **MAY** = optional.

You do not need to follow RFC 2119 exactly, but **being consistent** helps everyone know what is mandatory and what is optional [web:387][web:399].

### 3. Keep It Lean and Focused

- Do **not** try to document every implementation detail.  
- Focus on:

  - what the protocol **must guarantee**,  
  - and what the implementer is **allowed to choose** (e.g., internal algorithms, serialization format).

This keeps the spec readable and maintainable.

## How This Fits Into Flow‑Style Work

In Flow‑style protocols you can:

- Write a **core spec** for the protocol (e.g., governance‑state machine, reward‑calculation rules).  
- Write **second‑level specs** for:

  - specific **applications** (e.g., dashboard, CLI, API).  
  - or for **ML‑driven score layers** that plug into the protocol.

This separation allows:

- the **protocol spec** to stay stable,  
- while **applications** can evolve without changing the underlying rules.

Furthermore, a good spec:

- makes it easier to **add new actors** (e.g., new governance‑tools) later.  
- and makes **onboarding** new engineers much faster.

---

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Draft a Tiny Protocol Spec

Pick a small Flow‑style workflow (e.g., a proposal flow, reward‑calculation, or on‑ramp):

- Write a short spec that includes:

  - title, authors, and scope,  
  - a list of actors and roles,  
  - a small state‑machine description (states + transitions),  
  - a few “shall”‑style requirements.

Do not aim for perfection; aim for **clarity and testability**.

### Exercise 2: Add Examples and Diagrams

Using the same workflow:

- Add **one example scenario** (e.g., “happy‑path” and one “error‑path”).  
- Sketch a **state‑machine diagram** (boxes + arrows) and paste it into your lab repo.

This trains you to **write and draw at the same time**.

### Exercise 3: Review and Refine

Ask yourself:

- Is anything **still ambiguous**?  
- Are there places where **different implementers might disagree** on behavior?

Revise the spec to remove ambiguity and see how much clearer it becomes.

## Self‑Assessment

Rate yourself from 1 to 5:

- I can explain why a written specification is important for protocol design.  
- I can structure a spec with core sections (scope, actors, behavior, requirements, data, examples).  
- I can write simple “shall”‑style requirements that are testable.  
- I can see how diagrams and text fit together in a Flow‑style protocol spec.

Action item: write a short note in your lab repo describing one Flow‑style protocol you documented in a spec and how that changed how you think about the design.

## Next Steps

- Read `02-formal-and-semi-formal-notation.md` next to learn lightweight ways to add more rigor (e.g., simple state‑machine tables) to your specs.  
- Treat every new Flow‑style protocol as something that **must have a spec**, even if it is short.  
- Keep your specs living: update them as you learn and iterate, just like your codebase.
