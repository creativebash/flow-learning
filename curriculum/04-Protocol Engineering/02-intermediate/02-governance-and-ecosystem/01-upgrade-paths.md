# Upgrade Paths

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Explain what an **upgrade path** is and why it matters for evolving protocols and APIs.  
- Describe common **migration strategies** for moving from one protocol version to another (e.g., side‑by‑side, gradual cutover, migration tools).  
- Design a **clear, safe migration plan** for a Flow‑style protocol (e.g., governance‑state machine, reward‑calculation) from v1 to v2.  
- Communicate **deprecation timelines** and **backwards‑compatibility policies** to other teams and users.

## Introduction

At the intermediate level, you cannot assume that your protocol will stay at `v1` forever.  
New features, performance improvements, and corrected design flaws will require **breaking or non‑breaking changes** over time [web:477][web:481].

An **upgrade path** is the **planned route** from an older version of a protocol or API to a newer version, designed so that:

- existing clients can **migrate safely**, and  
- the system can **evolve without breaking everyone at once** [web:481][web:487].

In Flow‑style systems, this is especially important because:

- protocols may be used by:

  - governance dashboards,  
  - ML‑scoring services,  
  - and on‑ramp tools,  

often built by different teams at different times.

Planning upgrade paths early reduces:

- chaos in production,  
- “stuck” clients on old versions, and  
- risk of fragmented ecosystems.

## What Is an Upgrade Path?

An **upgrade path** is a set of **steps and constraints** that describe how to move from **one state (e.g., v1 protocol)** to **another (e.g., v2)**:

- who can upgrade,  
- when,  
- in what order, and  
- with what guarantees.

Two complementary ideas:

- **Backwards compatibility**: newer v2 servers can still talk to older v1 clients.  
- **Forwards compatibility**: v1 clients can still talk to v2 servers where possible, or at least fail gracefully.

In practice, an upgrade path usually includes:

- **Timeline**: when v1 will be deprecated, when v2 goes live.  
- **Tooling**: migration scripts, converters, or bridges.  
- **Escalation plan**: what to do if something goes wrong (e.g., rollback, feature flags).

For Flow‑style protocols, this is a **governance and engineering concern**, not just an infra detail.

---

## Common Upgrade‑Path Patterns

### 1. Side‑by‑Side Deployment

Run **v1 and v2 in parallel**, so that:

- clients can choose which version to use,  
- and new clients can start on v2 while old ones stay on v1.

Typical setup:

- v1 and v2 expose **different endpoints or URIs** (e.g., `/v1/...` vs `/v2/...`).  
- A **load balancer**, **feature flags**, or a **routing rule** controls which traffic goes where.

Advantages:

- smooth, **gradual migration**,  
- ability to **A/B** compare v1 and v2 behavior.

Disadvantages:

- requires **running two stacks** for a time,  
- and careful **state‑synchronization** if they share underlying data.

Flow‑style motivation:

- lets governance‑tools and dashboards migrate at their own pace.

### 2. Gradual Cutover (Traffic‑Shifting)

Instead of a “big‑bang” switch, you:

- slowly **shift traffic** from v1 to v2, e.g., via:

  - DNS,  
  - traffic‑management services, or  
  - feature‑flag percentages.

This is common in cloud‑style environments where you can:

- route 10%, 50%, then 100% of governance‑ or learner‑traffic to v2.

Benefits:

- if v2 has bugs, you can **pause or roll back**.  
- reduces risk of massive disruption.

Flow‑style use‑case:

- shifting governance‑proposal traffic from v1 to v2 while monitoring for state‑consistency issues.

### 3. Migration Tools and Converters

Some protocols provide:

- an official **migration tool** that converts v1‑style data or state into v2‑style.

Examples:

- Aave provided a **v1 → v2 migration tool** for positions and funds [web:481].  
- Other blockchains provide **snapshot‑ and replay‑based** migration tools.

How this works in practice:

- freeze or mark v1 as read‑only,  
- run a converter that transforms governance‑state or reward‑state into v2 format,  
- then start v2 from the converted state.

This is powerful when v2 has a **changed state‑machine** or schema.

Flow‑style twist:

- you can design similar **“state‑converter”** binaries that translate Flow‑style learner‑or‑governance state across versions.

### 4. Optional vs Mandatory Migration

Sometimes v1 → v2 is:

- **Optional**: teams can keep using v1 for a while, but no new features are added there.  
- **Mandatory**: after a deprecation date, v1 is shut down, and everyone must upgrade.

Best practice:

- start with **optional**, then move to **mandatory** after a deprecation window.

This gives teams time to plan, test, and train.

Flow‑style motivation:

- lets slower‑moving governance communities or dashboards avoid forced rush‑upgrades.

## How to Design a Concrete Upgrade Path

For a Flow‑style protocol, a good upgrade‑path design usually includes these steps:

### 1. Assess the Change

- Classify the change:

  - **Backwards‑compatible** (e.g., added optional fields) → can keep v1 and v2 alive together.  
  - **Breaking** (e.g., removed fields, changed state‑machine) → likely requires a migration plan.

- Decide whether you will:

  - support both versions,  
  - or force a migration.

### 2. Define a Timeline

- Publish a **timeline** with:

  - release date of v2,  
  - “soft” deprecation date of v1,  
  - and “hard” shutdown date of v1.

Clear deprecation dates prevent **accidental lock‑in** to old versions.

Flow‑style best practice:

- keep the deprecation window **long enough** for governance bodies and dashboards to coordinate.

### 3. Build Tooling and Scripts

Design a **migration path** between versions by:

- writing:

  - **state‑conversion scripts**,  
  - **idempotent migration tools** that can be rerun safely,  
  - and **validation checks** that confirm state is consistent after migration.

Example:

- a script that:

  - dumps v1 governance‑proposals,  
  - transforms them into v2‑style state,  
  - and validates that `APPROVED` proposals still have the same semantics.

### 4. Test the Upgrade in Staging

- Run the upgrade on **staging or canary** environments that mirror production.  
- Verify that:

  - dashboards still show correct state,  
  - forecasts and ML‑style scores still work,  
  - and governance‑nodes behave as expected.

Testing the upgrade path is as important as testing the protocol itself.

### 5. Communicate, Communicate, Communicate

- Publish:

  - upgrade guide,  
  - deprecation schedule,  
  - and example clients or adapters.

Clear communication reduces:

- confusion,  
- and the risk of “someone forgot to upgrade.”

Flow‑style style:

- treat upgrade communication as part of **governance and on‑boarding**, not just ops.

## How This Fits Into Flow‑Style Systems

In Flow‑style protocols you can:

- plan upgrades around **versioned specs** (from `01‑specification‑writing.md`) and **semantic versioning** (from `02‑versioning‑strategies.md`).  
- use **migration‑style thinking** not just for protocols, but for:

  - governance‑state machines,  
  - reward‑calculation logic,  
  - and learner‑on‑ramp flows.

Upgrade‑path design connects directly to:

- **deployment patterns** (e.g., side‑by‑side, canary, feature flags),  
- **governance** (e.g., “when will this v2 change be mandated?”),  
- and **MLOps** (e.g., “will this protocol change break ML‑based reward‑scoring?”).

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Sketch an Upgrade Path for a Flow‑Style Protocol

Take a protocol you have designed (e.g., governance‑state machine or reward‑calculation):

- Decide whether v2 will be **backwards‑compatible** or **breaking**.  
- Sketch an upgrade path that includes:

  - side‑by‑side or gradual cutover plan,  
  - a simple state‑migration idea (e.g., JSON‑to‑JSON transform),  
  - and a deprecation timeline.

Write it as a short plan, not full code.

### Exercise 2: Design a Migrating Script

- For the same protocol, design a **state‑migration script** at the API level:

  - which endpoints or data you would read from v1,  
  - how you would transform it,  
  - and which endpoints or data you would write into v2.

This trains you to think in **data‑flow terms**, not just state‑machine diagrams.

### Exercise 3: Plan for Rollback

- Imagine your v2 deployment has a bug that breaks governance‑state semantics.  
- Sketch a **rollback plan**:

  - from v2 back to v1 (or a safe v1.1),  
  - including data‑backup and validation steps.

This trains you to treat upgrades as **two‑way paths**, not one‑way jumps.

## Self‑Assessment

Rate yourself from 1 to 5:

- I can explain what an upgrade path is and why it matters for protocols and APIs.  
- I can describe common patterns (side‑by‑side, gradual cutover, migration tools, optional vs mandatory).  
- I can sketch a concrete upgrade path for a Flow‑style protocol.  
- I can connect upgrade paths to deployment patterns and governance decisions.

Action item: write a short note in your lab repo describing one upgrade path you designed for a Flow‑style protocol and how it balances safety, risk, and coordination across teams.

## Next Steps

- Read `02-governance-models-for-evolution.md` next to see how to align upgrade paths with **on‑chain or off‑chain governance bodies**.  
- Treat every major protocol release as something that must have a **written upgrade path and deprecation schedule**.  
- When you release a Flow‑style protocol, document not only the v2 design, but **how v1 clients will move into it safely**.
