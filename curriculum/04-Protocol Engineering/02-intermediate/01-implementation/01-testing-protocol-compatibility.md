# Testing Protocol Compatibility

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Explain the difference between **conformance**, **compatibility**, and **interoperability testing** for protocols [web:435][web:438].  
- Design simple **compatibility test cases** for a Flow‑style protocol (e.g., governance‑state updates, reward‑events, learner‑onboarding flows).  
- Use **test clients** and **mocked services** to verify that multiple implementations of the same protocol can talk to each other.  
- Apply **environment‑based testing** (e.g., network conditions, version mixes) to uncover hidden protocol bugs [web:439][web:443].

## Introduction

In the beginner tier you learned:

- how to write a protocol specification,  
- how to version it, and  
- how to design it for interoperability.

Now, at the **intermediate** level, you must ask:

> “How do we **test** that implementations of this protocol actually **work the same way**, under different conditions, and across different versions?”

This is **protocol compatibility testing**. It sits at the intersection of:

- **conformance** (does implementation A follow the spec?),  
- **compatibility** (do A and B run together without breaking?), and  
- **interoperability** (do they behave meaningfully when talking to each other?) [web:435][web:438].

For Flow‑style systems, this is essential because:

- protocols may be implemented by different teams or languages,  
- and you cannot afford to discover incompatibilities in production.

## What Is Protocol Compatibility Testing?

**Protocol compatibility testing** verifies that:

- different **implementations** of the same protocol  
- can **exchange messages correctly** and  
- maintain the **intended behavior** under realistic conditions [web:439][web:442].

Three related but distinct ideas:

- **Conformance testing**: does a single implementation follow the spec correctly?  
- **Compatibility testing**: do implementations work together across versions, platforms, and environments?  
- **Interoperability testing**: do they exchange data and coordinate in a **semantically meaningful** way?

In practice, you often:

- start with **conformance tests** on a single implementation,  
- then move to **interoperability tests** between two or more implementations.

For Flow‑style protocols, this is what guarantees that:

- a governance‑node, a dashboard, and an ML‑scoring service  
- can all agree on the meaning of events and state.

---

## Key Types of Protocol Tests

### 1. Message‑Format and Parsing Tests

These check that:

- messages are **serialized** and **deserialized** correctly.  
- all implementations read the **same meaning** from a byte‑ or JSON‑blob.

Examples:

- Generate example payloads according to your spec and feed them to multiple clients, checking that they all parse the same fields.  
- Test **edge cases** (e.g., missing optional fields, malformed JSON, unknown keys).

This is the **first layer** of compatibility: if parsing fails, nothing else works.

### 2. State‑Machine and Behavior Tests

Using the state‑machine model from earlier lessons, you can:

- write **scenarios** that walk the protocol through a sequence of messages.  
- check that the **state** evolves as expected (e.g., `DRAFT` → `UNDER_REVIEW` → `APPROVED` → `EXECUTED`).

Automated tests can:

- spin up a **test node** and a **test client**,  
- send a sequence of messages,  
- and assert that the end‑state matches the spec.

This is **conformance‑style** testing for the protocol logic.

### 3. Inter‑Implementation Interoperability Tests

Here you verify that **two independent implementations** of the same protocol can talk:

- for example, “Implementation A (Rust)” ↔ “Implementation B (Python)”.  

You can:

- run both in a test harness,  
- have them exchange messages,  
- and check that both agree on:

  - state,  
  - error codes,  
  - and side‑effects (e.g., emitted events, logs).

Such tests are powerful because they expose **hidden assumptions** in the spec.

---

## How to Structure Compatibility Test Cases

A good compatibility test for a protocol typically has:

- a **setup** (e.g., “start node A and node B”),  
- a **sequence** of messages or events,  
- an **expected outcome** (e.g., “node A and node B both reach state `APPROVED`”),  
- and **cleanup** (e.g., shutdown, logs, and artifacts).

### Example Test Case Template

For a Flow‑style governance‑proposal protocol:

1. **Setup**:

   - Start two nodes (Node A and Node B) that both implement the protocol spec.  
   - Ensure they are “peers” in the same network (e.g., connected over TCP or HTTP‑style APIs).

2. **Action**:

   - Have Node A send a `PROPOSAL_SUBMIT` message with valid payload.  
   - Wait for Node B to receive and process it.

3. **Assert**:

   - Both nodes should transition to `UNDER_REVIEW`.  
   - Both should emit a `proposal.submitted` event with the same `proposal_id`.  
   - No parsing or state‑transition errors should be logged.

4. **Teardown**:

   - Stop both nodes and collect logs for comparison.

You can then **parameterize** the test with:

- different message corruptions,  
- network delays, or  
- version mismatches.

This pattern scales to more complex flows and edge cases.

## Testing Across Environments and Conditions

Compatibility is not just “in‑memory, on‑localhost” correctness; it is about real‑world behavior [web:439][web:443].

You should test your protocol under:

### 1. Network Conditions

- **Latency and jitter**: simulate slow or unstable networks.  
- **Packet loss**: drop or reorder messages according to the transport.  
- **Bandwidth limits**: test that the protocol does not break under high‑load or low‑bandwidth conditions.

Tools:

- local network emulators,  
- Kubernetes network policies,  
- or simple test‑harness logic that introduces delays.

### 2. Version Mixing

- Test:

  - “v1 client” ↔ “v2 server”,  
  - “v2 client” ↔ “v1 server”.

This is especially important if you follow semantic versioning [web:434][web:439].

Observe:

- whether the protocol gracefully handles unknown fields or messages,  
- whether error codes and fallbacks behave as documented.

Version‑mixing tests expose:

- whether your **versioning strategy** is doing its job.

### 3. Platform and Language Differences

- Run the same protocol test on **different OSes**, **runtimes**, or **languages**.  
- Ensure that:

  - time formats,  
  - numeric encodings,  
  - and string handling  
  do not introduce discrepancies.

This is where **interoperability** really shows its value.

## How to Test with Mocks and Stubs

For end‑to‑end Flow‑style flows, you often need to:

- **mock downstream services** (e.g., governance‑node, scoring engine),  
- or **stub event‑emitters**.

This lets you:

- isolate the protocol logic from unrelated failures (e.g., broken ML model, DB down).  

Common patterns:

- **Mocking the transport layer**: for example, fake TCP or HTTP‑style endpoints that replay canned responses.  
- **Stubbing events**: replace a real pub/sub broker with an in‑memory queue during tests.

Mocking helps you:

- focus on **protocol behavior** rather than infrastructure,  
- while still protecting you from integration bugs later.

---

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Write a Conformance Test for a Flow‑Style Protocol

Take a Flow‑style governance‑ or reward‑style protocol you already specified:

- Write a **single test case** that:

  - sends a valid message sequence (e.g., `submit` → `approve` → `execute`),  
  - and checks that the state machine reaches the expected end‑state.  

Run this test in a small harness (e.g., Rust test binary, Python test script, or CI pipeline).

### Exercise 2: Build a Basic Interop Harness

- Implement the **same protocol** in two different languages (or two branches) that:

  - share the same spec and schema.  
- Write a test that:

  - starts both nodes,  
  - has them exchange messages,  
  - and checks that they agree on state and behavior.

This is a **minimum viable** interoperability test you can grow over time.

### Exercise 3: Introduce Network Conditions

- Extend your interop test to:

  - add random delays or failures to messages,  
  - or drop a percentage of messages.  

Observe:

- whether the protocol recovers,  
- and whether the test still passes or fails in a predictable way.

This trains you to think in **real‑world network conditions**, not just “happy‑path” scenarios.

## Self‑Assessment

Rate yourself from 1 to 5:

- I can explain the difference between conformance, compatibility, and interoperability testing.  
- I can design simple test cases that verify protocol‑state evolution and message‑format correctness.  
- I can set up a basic interop‑style test between two implementations of the same protocol.  
- I can see how to test across environments (network, version, platform) to uncover hidden bugs.

Action item: write a short note in your lab repo describing one protocol compatibility test you wrote for a Flow‑style protocol and what it revealed about the design.

## Next Steps

- Read `02-equivalence-and-refinement.md` next to learn how to reason about **when one protocol implementation refines or preserves another**.  
- Treat compatibility testing as a **core part of your CI/CD pipeline**, not a one‑off exercise.  
- When you release a new protocol version, include a **compatibility‑test matrix** (e.g., v1 client vs v2 server) to guide migrations.
