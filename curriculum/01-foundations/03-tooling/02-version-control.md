# Version Control for Engineers

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Explain why version control matters in real engineering work.  
- Use Git to track changes, review history, and recover from mistakes.  
- Collaborate safely with others using branches and pull requests.  
- Apply version‑control practices to your Flow Initiative curriculum and labs.

## Introduction

Version control is the backbone of collaborative engineering. Without it:

- It is difficult to see what changed and why.  
- Multiple people cannot work on the same code safely.  
- Recovering from a bad change or experiment becomes risky.

In the Flow Initiative, every lesson, lab, and contribution lives in a version‑controlled repository. Git is the tool that lets you:

- Commit your work,  
- Review changes,  
- Branch and experiment, and  
- Merge improvements back into the shared codebase.

For African‑centric engineering, good version‑control habits are especially important when working asynchronously and across time zones.

## What Is Version Control?

Version control is a system that:

- Tracks every change to a project.  
- Lets you see who changed what and when.  
- Lets you revert or branch from a known state.

Git is the most widely used version‑control system. It is distributed, which means every contributor has a full copy of the history.

## Why Engineers Need Version Control

Without version control, you rely on:

- Copying folders with names like `project_v2_backup_final`.  
- Manually comparing text files.  
- Losing work when mistakes happen.

With Git:

- Every change is recorded.  
- You can experiment safely in branches.  
- You can review changes before they are merged.  
- You can roll back to a known‑good state.

This is essential for:

- Open‑source collaboration,  
- Labs that evolve over time,  
- Curriculum content that the whole team maintains.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Repository

A **repository** (or “repo”) is a project’s version‑controlled space. It contains:

- Code,  
- Markdown/lesson files,  
- Configuration, and  
- The history of changes.

The Flow Initiative monorepo is a Git repository.

### 2. Commit

A **commit** is a snapshot of changes at a point in time. Every commit has:

- A message explaining the change.  
- A list of modified files.  
- A timestamp and author.

Good commits are small and focused on one logical change.

### 3. Branch

A **branch** is a line of development. It lets you:

- Work on a new feature without breaking the main version.  
- Experiment safely.  
- Submit changes for review without affecting everyone immediately.

In Flow, you will often work on a branch before opening a pull request.

### 4. Pull Request (PR)

A **pull request** is a proposal to merge changes from one branch into another. It is the primary place for:

- Code review,  
- Discussion, and  
- Documentation of changes.

In the Flow program, every curriculum update, lab, or contribution should be reviewed via a PR.

### 5. Conflict and Merge

A **conflict** happens when two people change the same part of a file differently. Resolving a conflict means deciding which version to keep or how to combine them.

A **merge** combines the changes from one branch into another after conflicts are resolved.

## Using Git in Practice

For Flow trainees, Git is used to:

- Contribute lessons to `curriculum/`.  
- Submit lab implementations to `labs/`.  
- Propose new articles or fixes to `knowledge-base/`.  
- Track documentation changes in `website/`.

Here are the basic patterns you will use.

### 1. Initialize and Clone

To start:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flow-education/flow-hub.git
```

This copies the entire repo to your local machine.

### 2. Branch for a Task

Create a branch for the work you plan to do:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-lesson
```

Name your branch meaningfully, e.g., `fix/lesson-typo`, `feat/blockchain-lab-01`, `docs/reading-comprehension-exercise`.

### 3. Make and Commit Changes

Edit your files (e.g., Markdown lessons, lab code), then:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe what you changed"
```

A good commit message:

- Starts with a verb in the imperative (e.g., `Add`, `Fix`, `Update`).  
- Explains the change in one line.  
- Describes why it matters if needed.

### 4. Push and Open a Pull Request

Push your branch:

```bash
git push origin feature/new-lesson
```

On GitHub, open a pull request from that branch to `main` (or `master`, depending on convention). In the PR, describe:

- What this change does.  
- Why it is needed.  
- How it was tested.

### 5. Review and Merge

Team members will review your changes, suggest edits, and approve the PR. Once approved, it is merged:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
```

Your local repo now reflects the updated state.

## Version Control and Safe Experimentation

Git encourages experimentation:

- Create a branch to try a new idea.  
- Break things, then decide whether to keep or discard the changes.  
- If the experiment fails, you can always return to a stable state.

In Flow, this is crucial for:

- Trying aggressive optimizations.  
- Testing new learning patterns.  
- Exploring new protocol or AI techniques.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Large, Unfocused Commits

Committing “everything” at once makes it hard to review and revert.

**Solution:**  
Make small, focused commits. One logical change per commit.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring the Commit Message

A vague message like “fix stuff” does not help anyone.

**Solution:**  
Write clear, descriptive messages that explain what changed and why.

### Mistake 3: Forgetting to Pull Changes

If you do not pull the latest changes, you may create conflicts.

**Solution:**  
Always pull the latest changes before starting new work.

### Mistake 4: Not Using Branches

Working directly on `main` is risky because mistakes affect everyone.

**Solution:**  
Use feature branches for every new change.

## Version Control and Flow Initiative Workflow

In Flow, the version‑control workflow supports:

- Human‑in‑the‑loop review of AI‑generated content.  
- Iterative refinement of lessons and labs.  
- Public‑goods documentation that is transparent and auditable.

Every trainee should:

- Learn basic Git commands.  
- Open PRs for their contributions.  
- Respond to feedback on those PRs.  
- Take ownership of the code and documentation they submit.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Create a Feature Branch

Pick a small change you can make (e.g., add a note to a lab or fix a typo):

- Create a new branch.  
- Edit a file.  
- Commit and push the branch.  
- Open a pull request on GitHub.

Practice this until it feels natural.

### Exercise 2: Review a Pull Request

Find a pull request in the Flow repo (or simulate one with a teammate):

- Read the diff.  
- Ask clarifying questions.  
- Suggest improvements or mark it as approved.

### Exercise 3: Reset and Re‑do

Make a small intentional mistake in a local branch (e.g., delete a line you did not mean to):

- Practice restoring it from Git history.  
- Commit the fix with a clear message.

This helps you get comfortable with recovery.

## Self‑Assessment

Rate yourself from 1 to 5:

- I understand why version control matters.  
- I can create and switch Git branches.  
- I can make clear, small commits.  
- I can open and review a pull request.

Action item: complete at least one end‑to‑end Git workflow (branch → commit → push → PR → review) in the Flow repo.

## Next Steps

- Read `03-collaboration-workflows.md` next to see how version control integrates with communication and collaboration.  
- Treat every change in the Flow monorepo as a practice opportunity with Git.  
- View your Git history as a record of your engineering growth.
