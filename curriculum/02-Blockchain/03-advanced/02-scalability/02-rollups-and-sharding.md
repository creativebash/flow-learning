# Rollups and Sharding

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Explain how **rollups** and **sharding** scale blockchain throughput without sacrificing security.  
- Distinguish between **validity‑proof rollups**, **fraud‑proof rollups**, and **sharded L1s**.  
- Map rollup and sharding patterns to trade‑offs in latency, security, and decentralization.  
- Use these patterns strategically in Flow‑style L1/L2 designs.

## Introduction

Blockchain L1s are limited by how fast all nodes can process every transaction.  
**Rollups** and **sharding** are two major families of solutions that:

- Push **most computation or data off‑chain or to a subset of nodes**,  
- While **still anchoring trust to the L1** or a single security layer.

From an engineer’s view:

- A **rollup** is a **layer‑2 system** that batches many transactions and submits proofs or data to the L1.  
- **Sharding** is a way for the L1 itself to split work across **parallel “shards”** that coordinate via a shared validator set.

Neither is magic; both are **system design choices** that trade off ease‑of‑use for complexity and trust assumptions.

This lesson focuses on **concepts and mental models**, not low‑level protocol specs.

## What Are Rollups?

A **rollup** is an L2 system that:

- Processes many transactions **off‑chain**.  
- Periodically submits a **compressed representation** (e.g., state root, proof, or data) to the L1.  
- Lets the L1 (or an on‑chain contract) **verify or adjudicate** disputes if needed.

At a high level, a rollup looks like:

- **On‑chain**:  
  - A contract that accepts state roots or proofs.  
  - A mechanism for users to deposit and withdraw.

- **Off‑chain**:  
  - A sequencer or set of nodes that execute transactions.  
  - A layer that produces proofs or data that can be checked on‑chain.

Users benefit from:

- High throughput and low fees on the L2.  
- The security of the L1 anchoring the final state.

---

## Types of Rollups

### 1. Validity‑Proof Rollups (“ZK‑Rollups”)

- The L2 computes a **cryptographic proof** (often zero‑knowledge) that some state change is valid.  
- The L1 contract **verifies the proof** and accepts the state if it passes.

Properties:

- Strong **safety**: invalid state cannot be accepted.  
- Fast **finality** once the proof is submitted.  
- Complex **cryptography**, both to design and run.

Good fit for:

- High‑security, high‑value applications.  
- Systems where trustless verification is preferred.

### 2. Fraud‑Proof Rollups (“Optimistic Rollups”)

- The L2 assumes the sequencer is honest by default.  
- Off‑chain challengers can submit **fraud proofs** to the L1 if they detect invalid state.

Properties:

- Simple **computation** on the L2; heavy work only on disputes.  
- Cheaper to operate in normal conditions.  
- Requires a **challenge window** during which anyone can dispute.

Good fit for:

- General‑purpose applications.  
- Systems where disputes are rare but must be handled.

## How Rollups Fit Into the Ecosystem

Rollups sit **on top of an L1**:

- The L1 provides **security and data availability**.  
- The L2 provides **scalability and UX**.

You can mentally place rollups like this:

- **On‑chain L1** → **Rollups** → **State channels**.

Each layer is optimized for different workloads:

- **On‑chain**: settlement, governance, rare high‑value interactions.  
- **Rollups**: frequent, high‑volume transactions and computations.  
- **State channels**: very frequent, low‑value, small‑group interactions.

For Flow‑style engineers, this is a **tiered scaling model**: you choose where to put each flow based on value, frequency, and trust requirements.

---

## What Is Sharding?

**Sharding** is a way for the L1 itself to:

- Split the state and computation into **parallel shards**.  
- Have each shard processed by a **subset of validators**,  
- With a **shared layer** that coordinates across shards.

Conceptually:

- A **shard** is a mini‑chain with its own state and transactions.  
- Validators hop between shards or rotate, so that **no one shard is permanently controlled**.  
- Shard size and validator count are tuned to keep the system decentralizable.

Sharding trades **simplicity** for **throughput**:

- Each shard can process transactions in parallel.  
- But cross‑shard communication is more complex.

## Rollups vs. Sharding

| Aspect                | Rollups                                                  | Sharding                                                       |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Where it lives**    | Layer‑2 (on top of L1)                                   | Built into the L1 itself                                       |
| **Trust model**       | Anchored to L1 security                                  | Security shared across shards                                  |
| **Complexity**        | Adds off‑chain sequencers and proofs                     | Adds cross‑shard coordination and validator rotation           |
| **Throughput**        | Can be very high for many use cases                      | High, but limited by shard count and communication overhead    |
| **Flexibility**       | Easy to add new rollups for specific apps                | Changing the sharding structure is a major protocol upgrade    |

Neither is universally “better.”  
You choose:

- **Rollups** when you want **flexible, app‑specific scaling** on top of an existing L1.  
- **Sharding** when you want **deep integration** and **massive parallelization** at the L1 level.

## Why This Matters for Flow Engineers

Flow‑style engineers will:

- Encounter rollups and sharded L1s in many ecosystems.  
- Design or critique systems that must balance **speed, security, and cost**.  
- Need to decide **where to put each layer** (on‑chain, rollup, channel).

Understanding rollups and sharding helps you:

- **Architect** systems that push low‑value, high‑frequency flows to L2s while keeping security on‑chain.  
- **Communicate** trade‑offs to stakeholders (e.g., “this is a ZK‑rollup because we want trustless verification”).  
- **Evaluate** when a new protocol or tool is appropriate for a given context.

In African‑centric contexts, this is especially important when:

- Designing **public‑good protocols** that must be transparent and understandable.  
- Balancing **accessibility** (low fees, high throughput) with **security**.  
- Ensuring that **economic incentives** align with long‑term community interests.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Sketch a Rollup Architecture

Take a simple Flow‑style app:

- Draw a diagram showing:  
  - The L1.  
  - A rollup.  
  - A few users.
- Mark where transactions are processed, where proofs are submitted, and where disputes are handled.

Write a short note describing the flow.

### Exercise 2: Analyze a Sharded L1

Find a real‑world sharded L1 (e.g., a popular chain or research project):

- Identify how many shards it has.  
- Describe how validators rotate or coordinate across shards.  
- Write a short note explaining the **trade‑offs** of this design.

### Exercise 3: Relate to a Flow Lab

Look at a Flow‑style lab that involves frequent transactions:

- Design a small **rollup‑style** model for it:  
  - Who are the sequencers?  
  - What is the proof or data submitted to the L1?  
  - How are disputes handled?

This is a **high‑level design exercise** for the kind of flow you might implement later.

## Self‑Assessment

Rate yourself from 1 to 5:

- I can explain what a rollup is.  
- I can distinguish between validity‑proof and fraud‑proof rollups.  
- I can explain what sharding is.  
- I can see how these patterns fit into a Flow‑style system.

Action item: write a short note in your lab repo describing one Flow‑style system where rollups or sharding would improve scalability.

## Next Steps

- Read the next lesson in the advanced track (e.g., `03-state‑channels‑and‑LN‑style‑systems.md`) to see how this pattern generalizes to more complex networks.  
- Use this rollup and sharding mindset when you design or critique scalability solutions.  
- Treat rollups and sharding as **layered, scalable complements** to on‑chain and L1‑style systems.
