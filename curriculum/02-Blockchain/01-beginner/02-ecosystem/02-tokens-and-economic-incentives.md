# Tokens and Economic Incentives

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Define on‑chain tokens and their basic roles in blockchain systems.  
- Distinguish between utility and incentive‑driven tokens.  
- Connect token design to real‑world behaviors (e.g., securing nodes, rewarding users).  
- Reason about how incentives shape security, latency, and participation in L1/L2 ecosystems.

## Introduction

Tokens are not just “digital money.” In blockchain systems, they are **economic instruments** that encode value, rights, and constraints into the protocol itself.

In the Flow Initiative, you will see tokens used to:

- Pay for gas and execution,  
- Reward validators and stakers,  
- and coordinate user behavior across L1s and L2s.

This lesson treats tokens as **engineering tools**, not marketing stories. You will learn how they change incentives for participants and how that, in turn, affects the system’s behavior.

## What a Token Is (Technically)

At the most basic level, a **token** on a blockchain is:

- A **quantity** of value stored in the chain’s state.  
- Tied to an **address** (account or contract).  
- Transferred by **transactions** that update that state.

Different token models exist:

- **Fungible tokens** — each unit is interchangeable (like payment tokens).  
- **Non‑fungible tokens (NFTs)** — each unit is unique and can represent distinct assets.

For this lesson, focus on **fungible tokens** used in economic design.

A token balance is **not** a physical thing. It is a **state variable** in a smart contract or native module, updated deterministically by transactions.

## Why Tokens Matter for Incentives

Tokens are the **carriers of value** that align behavior:

- Participants are willing to spend time, compute, or money  
  because they expect to receive tokens or avoid losing them.

In blockchain:

- **Validators** stake tokens to secure the network and earn rewards.  
- **Users** pay token‑based fees to execute transactions.  
- **Protocols** distribute tokens to bootstrap participation (e.g., liquidity, usage).

This is how economics becomes part of the **system design**, not just a separate layer.

## Token Roles in L1/L2 Systems

### 1. On the L1

On a Layer‑1 chain, tokens often serve:

- **Gas/fee settlement** — users pay in tokens to cover the cost of computation and storage.  
- **Staking/security** — validators lock tokens as collateral; if they misbehave, they lose those tokens.  
- **Protocol governance** — holders vote on upgrades, parameters, or fund allocations.

This means:

- Who controls tokens influences who controls the chain’s future.  
- How tokens are distributed affects decentralization and fairness.

### 2. On the L2

On a Layer‑2 (e.g., rollup, sidechain), tokens can appear in several ways:

- **Same‑asset tokens** — an L2 might mirror L1 assets or tokens, with claims ultimately resolvable on the L1.  
- **L2‑native tokens** — a token that lives entirely on the L2 and is used for local gas, rewards, or governance.

Even when the L2 uses its own token, it still depends on the **L1’s security** for ultimate accountability.

### 3. Between Layers

Tokens can also bridge:

- **Layer‑1 -> Layer‑2** — users move tokens between chains via bridges.  
- **Chain -> Real‑world** — token balances map to fiat value or utility in off‑chain systems.

As an engineer, you care about:

- where tokens are defined,  
- how they move, and  
- what guarantees the system offers about their balance.

## Common Incentive Patterns

### 1. Paying for Use

**Pattern:**  
Users pay **fees in tokens** to execute transactions or store data.

**Effect:**  
- Limits spam.  
- Compensates validators or operators.  
- Creates a direct feedback loop between demand and cost.

Engineers designing systems must decide:

- How much gas each operation consumes.  
- How to set or adjust prices under load.

### 2. Securing the Network

**Pattern:**  
Validators **stake tokens** as collateral and:

- Earn rewards for honest behavior.  
- Risk **slashing** (losing tokens) for misbehavior.

**Effect:**  
- Misbehavior becomes expensive.  
- Honest participation is rewarded.  
- Security is tied to the total value at stake.

This is central to **Proof‑of‑Stake (PoS)** and many modern L1s and L2s.

### 3. Bootstrapping Participation

**Pattern:**  
Protocols distribute tokens to early users, liquidity providers, or content‑creators.

**Effect:**  
- Incentivizes early adoption.  
- Aligns long‑term contributors with the protocol’s success.  
- Can concentrate power if not designed carefully.

Engineers need to think about:

- How distribution affects decentralization.  
- Whether early advantages can be abused.

## How Incentives Affect System Behavior

Incentives change how participants behave, which in turn affects:

- **Security** — how much an attacker would pay to corrupt the system.  
- **Latency** — how fast people are willing to include or process your transactions.  
- **Reliability** — how committed participants are to keeping the system running.

For example:

- If gas fees are low, users may spam the network, increasing latency.  
- If validators earn little reward, participation may drop, reducing security.  
- If tokens are too centralized, governance may not reflect community interests.

In engineering terms, incentive design is about **choosing the right price signals and penalties** so that the system behaves well under real‑world use.

## Why This Matters for Flow Engineers

In the Flow Initiative, you will encounter:

- L1/L2 systems where **gas and staking tokens** shape performance.  
- Token‑based incentives for **protocol contributors, node operators, or lab participants**.  
- Designs where **economic models and technical designs are tightly coupled**.

Understanding tokens and incentives helps you:

- Predict how users and validators will behave.  
- Design systems that are **secure, fair, and sustainable**.  
- Spot misaligned incentives that could lead to attacks or failure modes.

In African‑centric contexts, this is especially important when:

- Token value interacts with local currencies and payment rails.  
- Incentives drive participation in resource‑constrained environments.  
- Decentralized governance must genuinely reflect diverse stakeholders.

## Practical Examples You Will See

### Example 1: Gas on an L1

- A user submits a transaction that consumes 21,000 units of “gas.”  
- Each unit costs a small amount of the chain’s native token.  
- Validators earn this token as a fee for including the transaction.

As an engineer, you might measure **gas per operation** and **fee per user flow** to optimize UX.

### Example 2: Staking and Slashing on PoS

- Validators stake the chain’s token.  
- The protocol rewards them for honest validation and finality.  
- If a validator equivocates or goes offline, part of their stake is slashed.

You as an engineer can:

- Monitor how much is staked.  
- Check how rewards and slashing rules are encoded on‑chain.

### Example 3: Incentives in an L2

- An L2 uses a native token or mirrors an L1 token.  
- The L2 pays sequencers or validators in that token.  
- The L2 also charges gas‑like fees from users.

You can reason about:

- How fast finality affects the token’s value.  
- How high fees might push users off this L2.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Map Token Roles in a Chain

Pick a chain you know (e.g., Ethereum‑style, a testnet, or a local chain you’ve used):

- Identify the native token (or equivalent).  
- Write one sentence describing how it is used for gas.  
- Write one sentence describing how it is used for staking or consensus.  
- Write one sentence describing how it might be used in an L2 on top of that chain.

### Exercise 2: Sketch an Incentive Flaw

Imagine a simple blockchain system where:

- Validators earn a fixed token reward per block,  
- but there is no slashing for offline behavior.

Sketch or describe:

- How a validator could behave lazily or selfishly.  
- Why the current design does not punish that behavior.  
- One small change you could make to the incentive structure (e.g., add a small penalty or reward for uptime).

This is a **first‑order attack analysis** using incentives.

### Exercise 3: Relate to a Flow Lab

Look at a blockchain lab from the Flow curriculum that uses real or mock transactions:

- Identify where a token is used (e.g., gas, staking, rewards).  
- Write one sentence describing what that token pays for.  
- Write one sentence describing how that incentive shapes the behavior of the user or the node.

## Self‑Assessment

Rate yourself from 1 to 5:

- I can explain what a token represents in the chain’s state.  
- I can distinguish between fee‑paying and staking tokens.  
- I can see how incentives shape validator and user behavior.  
- I can connect token design to L1/L2 security and performance.

Action item: write a short note in your lab repo about one incentive pattern you would want to see in a Flow‑style L1/L2 ecosystem.

## Next Steps

- Read `03-decentralized-identity.md` next to see how identity and reputation can be layered on top of tokens and incentives.  
- Use this lesson as a grounding layer whenever you read token‑based incentive designs or whitepapers.  
- Treat incentives as part of the **system spec**, not an afterthought.
