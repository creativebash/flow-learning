# Decentralized Identity

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Define decentralized identity (DID) and self‑sovereign identity (SSI) in engineering terms.  
- Explain the roles of DIDs, wallets, and verifiable credentials.  
- Map decentralized identity concepts onto real‑world systems (e.g., education, access control).  
- Reason about how DIDs and credentials can be layered on top of L1/L2 blockchains.

## Introduction

Traditional identity systems are usually **centralized**: governments, corporations, or platforms issue and control your digital identity. In decentralized systems, the goal is different: identity should be **user‑controlled, portable, and verifiable without a central authority**.

In the Flow Initiative, you will see **decentralized identity** as one way to:

- Represent users across protocols,  
- Anchor trust to cryptographic proofs, and  
- Reduce reliance on opaque, centralized identity providers.

This lesson treats decentralized identity as a **system design pattern**, not just “Web3 identity.” You will learn the core primitives and how they can be composed with L1/L2 infrastructure.

## What Is Decentralized Identity?

Decentralized identity (often called **DID** or **SSI** — self‑sovereign identity) is a model where:

- **Users own and control** their identifiers.  
- **Credentials are issued once, stored by the user, and shared selectively**.  
- **Verification is cryptographic** and can be done without contacting the issuer.

From an engineer’s view, this is a **trust‑minimized identity layer** that can sit on top of blockchains, distributed ledgers, or other public‑goods infrastructure.

### Key Properties

- **User‑controlled**: no single entity fully owns or revokes your identity.  
- **Portable**: you can use the same identity across different services.  
- **Privacy‑preserving**: you can share only the attributes you choose.  
- **Verifiable**: anyone can cryptographically verify that a claim is real.

These are not just philosophical goals; they are **design constraints** that shape how you build identity systems.

## Core Components

### 1. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

A **DID** is a **persistent, user‑controlled identifier** for a person, organization, or device.

- It looks like a string such as `did:example:123...`.  
- It is **created by the user** (or via a wallet), not issued by a central registry.  
- The DID **resolves to a DID Document** that contains public keys and service endpoints used to interact with the identity [web:183][web:187].

Crucially, the DID document typically **does not store private data**; it stores cryptographic material and endpoints that let others authenticate the identity.

### 2. Identity Wallets

An **identity wallet** is a software tool that:

- Stores the user’s **private keys**.  
- Manages multiple DIDs and associated credentials.  
- Handles signing, encryption, and connection‑establishment for DID‑based protocols [web:182][web:189].

The wallet is the **user‑facing layer** of the identity system, similar to how a blockchain wallet manages private keys for on‑chain accounts.

### 3. Verifiable Credentials (VCs)

A **verifiable credential** is a cryptographically signed statement about the user, such as:

- “Issued by University X, this person completed Course Y.”  
- “Issued by Employer Z, this person is our employee.”

Key properties:

- The **issuer signs** the credential with a private key.  
- The **holder** stores it in their wallet.  
- When needed, the holder can present a **proof** (often selective) to a **verifier** [web:183][web:189].

The verifier can check the signature against the issuer’s public key (often stored on a DID) to confirm authenticity.

### 4. Trust Ecosystem

A **trust ecosystem** defines:

- Who is an allowed **issuer**.  
- What **credential types** exist.  
- How **revocation** or updates work.

This can be governed by a **decentralized trust framework** (e.g., a consortium‑style governance body) rather than a single company or government.

## How DIDs and Credentials Work Together

A typical flow for decentralized identity looks like this:

1. **Setup**  
   - The user creates a **DID** and stores it in a wallet.  
   - The DID document is published to a blockchain or distributed ledger for discovery.

2. **Issuance**  
   - An **issuer** (e.g., university, employer) creates a **verifiable credential** about the user.  
   - The issuer signs the credential and sends it to the user’s wallet.

3. **Storage**  
   - The user keeps the credential in the wallet, possibly alongside others.  
   - The user can choose which credentials to keep, delete, or rotate.

4. **Presentation**  
   - A **verifier** (e.g., job platform, protocol, service) requests a proof of a specific attribute.  
   - The wallet constructs a **cryptographic proof** (e.g., a zero‑knowledge or selective‑disclosure proof) and sends it.

5. **Verification**  
   - The verifier checks:  
     - The issuer’s signature.  
     - The credential’s validity (e.g., not expired or revoked).  
   - The verifier accepts or rejects the claim.

At no point is the user forced to share a full “profile.” Only the required attributes are revealed.

## Why This Matters for Flow Engineers

Flow Initiative trainees will work on systems that need:

- **Cross‑protocol identities** — the same person or node appearing in multiple chains and tools.  
- **Trust‑minimized verification** — confirming claims without calling a central authority for every check.  
- **Privacy‑respecting access control** — allowing users to share only what is necessary.

Decentralized identity helps you:

- Represent **students, engineers, or nodes** as reusable DIDs.  
- Issue **certificates or achievements** as verifiable credentials.  
- Design **access control** where the system checks proofs, not centralized databases.

In African‑centric contexts, this is especially relevant when:

- Centralized identity systems are fragmented or weak.  
- Users want to control their data and move it across borders.  
- Education and employment records need global, tamper‑resistant verification.

## How Blockchain Fits In

Blockchain is not the only place to store decentralized identity data, but it is a natural fit for several pieces:

- **DID registries** — DID documents or DID roots can be anchored to a chain.  
- **Credential registries** — hashes or revocation lists can be stored on‑chain.  
- **Governance** — on‑chain protocols or L1s can coordinate issuers, verifiers, and rules for trust frameworks [web:183][web:188].

L1s and L2s can then:

- Accept **proofs** tied to DIDs,  
- Verify credentials stored off‑chain but referenced on‑chain.

From an engineering standpoint, the chain is often the **issuance or verification anchor**, not the place where all user data lives.

## Practical Examples You Will Encounter

### Example 1: Education Credentials

- A university acts as an **issuer**.  
- It issues **verifiable credentials** for degrees, transcripts, or course completions.  
- Students store them in **identity wallets**.  
- Employers act as **verifiers** and can instantly confirm authenticity without calling the registrar’s office every time [web:191][web:188].

In Flow, this could become:

- A credential system for **completion of lessons or tracks**.  
- A wallet‑style interface for **trainees** where they collect Flow‑issued credentials.

### Example 2: Node or Contributor Identity

- A decentralized protocol wants to identify **honest validators or contributors**.  
- It issues **DIDs and credentials** to operators that pass certain tests.  
- Those credentials can be reused across different services or layers.

Engineers can then design **stake‑based or reputation‑based** systems where credentials are part of the security model.

### Example 3: Cross‑Platform Access

- A user has a DID issued by a trusted identity‑provider network.  
- Multiple services accept that DID as valid.  
- The user never needs to create a new account on each service; they reuse their existing identity.

This is how you can reduce **authentication friction** while preserving control.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Sketch a Simple DID Flow

On paper or in a text editor, sketch a simple flow with three roles:

- **Holder** (user),  
- **Issuer** (e.g., a “Flow Education” issuer),  
- **Verifier** (e.g., a protocol or service).

For each step:

- Write what data or message is exchanged.  
- Mark whether it is stored on‑chain, in the wallet, or elsewhere.

This is a **mental model** of how the three roles interact.

### Exercise 2: Map a Real‑World System to DIDs

Pick a real‑world identity‑heavy system you know (e.g., school ID, national ID, crypto wallet):

- Identify who currently acts as the **issuer** and who as the **holder**.  
- Explain how DID‑style identity would change that:  
  - Who would now control the identifier?  
  - Where would the credential live?  
  - How would verification work?

Write a short note with your answers.

### Exercise 3: Relate to a Flow Lab

Imagine a Flow lab or future project that uses:

- User accounts,  
- Reputation, or  
- access control.

Design a small schema:

- Which entities should have DIDs?  
- What kind of verifiable credentials should they hold?  
- How would a verifier in that system check the credentials?

Write it in a markdown note so you can expand it later.

## Self‑Assessment

Rate yourself from 1 to 5:

- I can explain what a DID and a verifiable credential are.  
- I can see how DIDs differ from email‑style identifiers.  
- I can connect decentralized identity to real‑world use cases (e.g., education, access control).  
- I can imagine how DIDs and credentials might sit on top of an L1/L2 stack.

Action item: write a short note in your Flow lab repo describing one concrete place where DIDs and verifiable credentials could improve privacy or trust.

## Next Steps

- Read the next lesson in the `ecosystem` section (or the next track) that builds on identity and trust.  
- Use this conceptual model whenever you encounter identity‑focused protocols or specs.  
- Treat decentralized identity as a **layered engineering primitive** that can be composed with L1/L2 systems, not as a separate “Web3 identity” silo.
