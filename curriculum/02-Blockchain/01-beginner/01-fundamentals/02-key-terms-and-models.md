# Key Terms and Models in Blockchain

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Recognize and define core blockchain terms (node, block, transaction, address, gas, etc.).  
- Distinguish between common blockchain models (public, private, consortium, L1, L2).  
- Map these terms and models onto real‑world examples from the Flow Initiative curriculum.  
- Use this vocabulary to read Ethereum‑style documents and protocol docs with confidence.

## Introduction

Blockchain systems are full of jargon. Some terms are marketing noise; others are actual technical primitives.  
In this lesson you will learn the **essential, engineering‑grade vocabulary** of blockchain and a few **simple models** that help you reason about how different systems work.

For Flow Initiative trainees, this is not a “dictionary” drill. It is a **concept map** that connects terminology to:

- decentralized ledgers,  
- smart contracts, and  
- incentive‑driven infrastructure.

Once you internalize these terms, later lessons on Ethereum‑style chains, L2s, and token economics will feel much more concrete.

## Core Blockchain Terms

### 1. Node

A **node** is a participant in the blockchain network that runs the protocol software.

Nodes can:

- Store the blockchain’s state and history.  
- Relay messages to other nodes.  
- Validate transactions and blocks.  
- (Optionally) propose or attest blocks, depending on the consensus model.

From an engineer’s view, a node is just **a process that follows agreed‑on rules** and talks to its peers.

### 2. Transaction

A **transaction** is a cryptographically signed message that requests a change to the system state.

In a payment‑style chain, this often means:

- Transfer value from one address to another.  
- Pay a fee for processing.

In smart‑contract chains, a transaction can also:

- Call a function in a contract,  
- Update storage,  
- Emit events.

A transaction is **deterministic**: given the same context, it always produces the same outcome.

### 3. Block

A **block** is a data structure that bundles multiple transactions (or state updates) and includes:

- A reference to the previous block (its hash).  
- A timestamp or block number.  
- A consensus‑related field (e.g., nonce, proposer signature, attester list).

Chaining blocks together creates the **ledger history**.

### 4. Block Hash

The **block hash** is a cryptographic digest of the block’s contents. It uniquely identifies the block and links it to the chain.

If even a single bit in the block changes, the hash changes, making tampering easy to detect.

### 5. Address

An **address** is a public identifier derived from a public key, often used to represent accounts or contracts.

There are typically two broad styles:

- **Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)** — controlled by a private key, used for users.  
- **Contract Accounts** — smart contracts that live on the chain and respond to transactions.

An address is **not a person**; it is a cryptographic identity.

### 6. Wallet

A **wallet** is a tool that:

- Manages your private keys.  
- Signs transactions on your behalf.  
- Interacts with the node or RPC provider.

Think of a wallet as your **user interface to the chain**, not the chain itself.

### 7. Gas / Fee

In many blockchains, users must pay a **fee** (often called **gas**) to execute transactions.

Gas serves two main purposes:

- It compensates validators/miners for work.  
- It constrains computation so that spam or infinite loops are too expensive.

As a developer, you care about:

- how much gas a transaction consumes,  
- and how gas price affects user experience.

### 8. State

The **state** is the current snapshot of the ledger: account balances, contract storage, and rules encoded in smart contracts.

Nodes keep a copy of the state and update it block by block.  
In many designs, state changes are **deterministic**: the same inputs and blocks always lead to the same state.

### 9. Consensus Mechanism

A **consensus mechanism** is the protocol that ensures nodes agree on:

- which blocks are valid,  
- in what order they are accepted.

Common families:

- **Proof‑of‑Work (PoW)** — nodes solve computational puzzles to propose blocks.  
- **Proof‑of‑Stake (PoS)** — nodes stake value as collateral to participate.  
- **Variants** like delegated PoS, Byzantine Fault‑tolerant (BFT) systems, etc.

Each consensus model makes different trade‑offs in security, decentralization, and performance.

### 10. Fork

A **fork** happens when the network has two or more competing chains of blocks.

Forks can be:

- **Temporary** — a “chain split” resolved automatically by the protocol.  
- **Permanent** — a deliberate protocol change that splits the community (e.g., a contentious upgrade).

Engineers must understand how their application behaves under different fork conditions.

## Common Blockchain Models

### 1. Public Blockchain

A **public** blockchain is open to anyone:

- Anyone can download the software.  
- Anyone can run a node.  
- Anyone can send transactions.  
- Anyone can validate or propose blocks (depending on consensus).

Examples: Bitcoin, Ethereum‑style chains.  
Public chains prioritize **censorship resistance** and **permission‑lessness**.

### 2. Private (Permissioned) Blockchain

A **private** blockchain restricts participation:

- Only a small set of known organizations or nodes can join.  
- Access to read or write state is controlled.

These are often used internally by enterprises for:

- auditing,  
- tracking,  
- or internal coordination.

They trade openness for control and privacy.

### 3. Consortium / Consortium‑Style Networks

A **consortium** model sits between public and private:

- A defined group of entities jointly operates the chain.  
- Governance is shared among participants.

This is common in:

- supply‑chain tracking,  
- regulated financial ecosystems,  
- or multi‑stakeholder data sharing.

### 4. Layer‑1 (L1) vs Layer‑2 (L2)

**Layer‑1** (L1) is the **base chain** that provides:

- consensus,  
- state, and  
- the primary security layer.

**Layer‑2** (L2) is a system that builds on top of an L1 to:

- improve throughput,  
- reduce fees, or  
- add features.

Typical L2 patterns:

- Rollups that **batch and submit proofs** to the L1.  
- Sidechains that operate under their own consensus but link back to the L1 for security or data availability.

Think of L1 as the “ground truth” and L2 as the “high‑capacity runway” above it [web:170].

## Why Models Matter for Engineers

Engineers do not just “use” a model; they design around its assumptions:

- On a **public L1**, you assume:

  - High latency and high cost for some operations.  
  - Transparent, auditable state.  
  - Long‑term immutability.

- On a **private or consortium** network, you assume:

  - Known participants.  
  - Faster finality.  
  - Stronger control over upgrades and access.

Knowing the model helps you:

- set realistic expectations for performance and security.  
- choose the right place to compute (on‑chain vs off‑chain).  
- design smart contracts that respect the network’s constraints.

## Relating Terms to the Flow Initiative

In the Flow curriculum, you will soon see these terms and models in:

- **`blockchain` track labs** — where you call contracts, read state, and send transactions.  
- **`protocol‑eng` track** — where you reason about consensus, nodes, and network behavior.  
- **`AI‑ML` / `blockchain` intersections** — where you use L1s or L2s as coordination layers for federated learning or incentive‑driven data markets.

For example:

- A **node** in a lab might be your local `geth` or `anvil` instance.  
- A **transaction** might be a small JS/Python script that interacts with a deployed contract.  
- A **gas fee** might be a number you watch while testing in a local environment.

Seeing these terms in practice helps you move from “vocabulary” to “mental model.”

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Create a Glossary Map

Make a small table or list that maps:

- Term (e.g., `node`, `transaction`, `block`)  
to  
- Your one‑sentence engineering definition.

Do this in `labs/` or in a markdown note so you can reuse it later.

### Exercise 2: Classify a Chain

Pick one blockchain you know (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, or a local chain you’ve used) and classify it:

- Is it **public**, **private**, or **consortium**?  
- Is it an **L1** or **L2**?  
- What is its main **consensus model**?

Write a short note explaining your classification.

### Exercise 3: Trace a Simple Flow

Imagine the simplest possible flow:

1. A user signs a transaction in a wallet.  
2. The transaction is sent to a node.  
3. The node relays it to the network.  
4. A validator includes it in a block.  
5. The block is added to the chain.

For each step, name the key term(s) involved (e.g., `wallet`, `node`, `transaction`, `validator`, `block`) and write a one‑sentence explanation.

## Self‑Assessment

Rate yourself from 1 to 5:

- I can define core blockchain terms in my own words.  
- I can distinguish between public, private, and consortium models.  
- I can differentiate L1 and L2 roles.  
- I can connect these terms to simple labs or examples.

Action item: update your Flow lab notes with a short glossary section using these terms.

## Next Steps

- Read `03-consensus-overview.md` next to see how consensus models turn these terms into operational behavior.  
- Use this lesson as a reference whenever you encounter a new protocol doc or SDK.  
- Treat terminology as part of your mental toolkit for reading, not just for writing.
