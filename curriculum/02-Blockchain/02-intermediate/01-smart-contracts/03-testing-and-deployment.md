# Testing and Deployment

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Identify the main steps in the contract lifecycle: write, test, deploy, monitor.  
- Use basic testing strategies (unit tests, integration tests, state checks).  
- Understand the difference between local testnets, testnets, and mainnets.  
- Apply a “deploy‑only‑when‑tested” discipline in Flow‑style labs.

## Introduction

Writing a contract is only half the story.  
You must also **test it thoroughly** and **deploy it safely** to the chain you care about.  
In the Flow Initiative, you will run contracts on:

- Local development environments,  
- Testnets, and  
- Simulated mainnets (or local chains standing in for them).

This lesson is not about learning every testing framework in depth.  
It is about **engineering discipline**: how to treat testing and deployment as part of the design process, not an afterthought.

## Why Testing Matters in Smart Contracts

Smart contracts differ from regular code in two ways:

- Once deployed, they are hard to change.  
- Bugs can lead to **irreversible loss of value**.

Testing is the **last line of defense** before deployment:

- You cannot rely solely on code review or “hope it works.”  
- You must check behavior under different conditions, inputs, and edge cases.

For Flow trainees, this is especially important because:

- Labs and examples can later evolve into production‑like systems.  
- African‑centric infrastructure often has **high stakes** and **low forgiveness** for mistakes.

Your job is to **build a testing mindset** into how you design and write contracts.

## Key Testing Strategies

### 1. Unit Tests

**Unit tests** verify small pieces of logic in isolation:

- Does a `transfer` function correctly update balances?  
- Do access‑control guards reject unauthorized callers?  
- Do state transitions match the expected pattern?

Unit tests are fast and deterministic.  
In Flow‑style labs, you may use frameworks like:

- Hardhat or Foundry for Solidity,  
- or Vyper‑specific tooling.

The goal is **coverage of core flows**, not every line.

### 2. Integration Tests

**Integration tests** check how multiple contracts work together:

- Does a token contract correctly interact with a governance or reward contract?  
- Do upgradeable patterns behave correctly under simulated upgrades?  
- Do L2 bridge patterns handle disputes or timeouts?

Integration tests are slower and more complex, but they reveal **system‑level bugs**.

### 3. State and Event Checks

In addition to function‑level checks, you should:

- Inspect the **on‑chain state** after key operations.  
- Check that **events** fire with the expected data.

This is how you verify that the contract’s *observable behavior* matches your expectations.

### 4. Fuzzing and Invariant Checks

More advanced teams add:

- **Fuzzing** — automatically generating random inputs to find edge cases.  
- **Invariant checks** — ensuring certain conditions always hold (e.g., total supply never decreases incorrectly).

For beginner–intermediate Flow labs, focus on **unit and integration tests**.  
Fuzzing and invariants are a “next‑level” practice.

## Deployment Environments

Contracts are typically deployed in stages:

### 1. Local Development Environment

- Runs on your machine.  
- No real economic value at stake.  
- Used for fast iteration and debugging.

Flow labs often start here: you write, test, and debug contracts without worrying about gas or permanence.

### 2. Testnet

- A public network with “fake” but valuable‑looking funds.  
- Used to test how contracts behave under real‑world conditions.  
- Catches issues like gas limits, network latency, and integration with real wallets.

Testnets are optional but recommended for anything that will interact with real users later.

### 3. Mainnet (or Equivalent)

- The production network where real value is at stake.  
- For Flow exercises, this may be a **simulated L1** or **local mainnet‑equivalent**.

Deployment here is **irreversible**.  
You must only deploy after thorough testing.

## Deployment Discipline

To avoid mistakes, adopt a deployment checklist:

1. **Code Review**  
   - Have another engineer (or the community) review the contract.  
   - Check for known anti‑patterns (e.g., reentrancy, overflow).

2. **Testing**  
   - Run all tests and ensure they pass.  
   - Check gas usage and performance under load.

3. **Environment**  
   - Decide if this is local, testnet, or mainnet‑style.  
   - Confirm the correct network and wallet.

4. **Post‑Deployment Checks**  
   - Verify that the contract is correctly deployed.  
   - Check events and state for a few transactions.

This discipline is crucial for Flow‑style systems that may later handle real‑world value.

## How This Fits Into the Flow Initiative

In Flow labs:

- You will write contracts in Solidity or Vyper.  
- You will run tests in your local environment.  
- You may deploy to a testnet or simulated chain for experimentation.

Your goal is to:

- Treat **testing as part of the design** process.  
- Use **clear, repeatable deployments**.  
- Learn from mistakes in a safe environment.

In African‑centric contexts, this is especially important when:

- You are building trustless systems for communities.  
- Gas cost and deployment safety directly affect users.  
- You must balance **security** and **accessibility**.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Write a Simple Test Plan

Take a small contract from a Flow lab:

- Write a short test plan identifying:  
  - What functions need unit tests.  
  - What scenarios need integration tests.  
  - What state and events to check.

This is a **high‑level test plan**, not code.

### Exercise 2: Sketch a Deployment Flow

Sketch a deployment flow for a Flow‑style contract:

- From local development to testnet to mainnet (or simulated mainnet).  
- Including code review, testing, and post‑deployment checks.

This is a **mental model** of the deployment lifecycle.

### Exercise 3: Relate to a Flow Lab

Look at a blockchain lab that mentions deployment:

- Write one sentence describing the deployment environment.  
- Write one sentence describing the test plan.  
- Write one sentence describing what you would improve.

This helps you see deployment as a **systematic process**.

## Self‑Assessment

Rate yourself from 1 to 5:

- I can explain the difference between unit and integration tests.  
- I can identify the main steps in the deployment lifecycle.  
- I can see why testing is crucial for smart contracts.  
- I can connect these practices to Flow‑style labs.

Action item: write a short note in your lab repo describing a deployment checklist for a Flow‑style contract.

## Next Steps

- Read the next lesson in the smart‑contracts track, such as `04-security-anti-patterns.md`, to see how to avoid common deployment mistakes.  
- Use this testing and deployment mindset whenever you write or deploy contracts.  
- Treat deployment as a **disciplined engineering process**, not a one‑time event.
