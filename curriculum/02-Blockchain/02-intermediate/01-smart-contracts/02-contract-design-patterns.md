# Contract Design Patterns

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Identify common on‑chain design patterns (modular, upgradeable, token‑like contracts).  
- Recognize standard patterns such as ERC‑20, ERC‑721, and basic access control.  
- Map patterns to trade‑offs in security, upgradeability, and composability.  
- Use this pattern sense when you read or write contracts in Flow labs.

## Introduction

Writing a smart contract is not just about syntax; it is about **architectural style**.  
The same business logic can be written in many ways, with very different consequences for:

- security,  
- upgradeability,  
- gas cost, and  
- how easy it is to compose with other contracts.

In the Flow Initiative, you will see many contracts that reuse well‑known patterns.  
This lesson teaches you to **recognize** those patterns, not just write them from scratch.

You do not need to memorize every line. You need to develop **pattern‑level intuition** so that when you open a contract, you can quickly answer:

- “What is this trying to do?”  
- “What assumptions is it making?”  
- “What risks does this pattern introduce?”

## What Is a Design Pattern?

In software engineering, a **design pattern** is a proven way to solve a recurring problem.  
In smart contracts, the problems are:

- How to represent balances and tokens.  
- How to grant and revoke permissions.  
- How to upgrade code without breaking data.  
- How to compose multiple contracts safely.

A pattern is **not** a piece of code you copy‑paste blindly. It is a **concept** that you adapt to your context.

For Flow trainees, this is especially important because:

- You will read and modify many contracts.  
- You will mix them with L1/L2 and token‑based incentives.  
- You will need to **change, not just consume**, existing patterns.

## Common Patterns in Contracts

### 1. Token‑Like Contracts (ERC‑20, ERC‑721)

Many contracts are built around **tokens** — fungible (ERC‑20‑style) or non‑fungible (ERC‑721‑style).

Key traits:

- A **mapping** from addresses to balances or IDs.  
- Core functions like `transfer`, `approve`, and `allowance`.  
- Events like `Transfer` and `Approval` for front‑ends and indexers.

From an engineer’s view:

- The pattern defines **who can move value** and **how transparency works**.  
- You can specialize it for Flow‑internal tokens, governance tokens, or local lab currencies.

### 2. Modular Contracts (Libraries and Interfaces)

Large systems rarely live in one file.  
Common patterns:

- **Libraries** — reusable code for math, data structures, or utilities.  
- **Interfaces** — abstract descriptions of what a contract can do, without implementation.  
- **Inheritance** (in Solidity) — reusing logic across multiple contracts.

Advantages:

- Avoid duplicating logic.  
- Make upgrades and changes more localized.  
- Support composability: many contracts calling each other.

Disadvantages:

- Extra complexity: you must reason about multiple files.  
- Harder to audit if the call graph is deep.

### 3. Upgradeable Contracts (Proxy Patterns)

Blockchains are immutable, but business rules change.  
To reconcile this, teams use **upgradeable patterns**:

- A **proxy** contract that stores the address of the real implementation.  
- An **implementation** contract that can be replaced.  
- An **admin** (or DAO) that controls upgrades.

From an engineer’s view:

- This pattern trades **trust** (who controls the admin?) for **flexibility**.  
- It is common in production protocols but riskier for trustless systems.

In Flow labs, you may see simplified proxies for experimentation, without deploying them to real funds.

### 4. Access Control (Ownable, Roles)

Many contracts control who can do what.  
Common patterns:

- **Ownable** contracts — one “owner” with special privileges.  
- **Role‑based access** — groups of users with defined permissions (e.g., “admin”, “minter”).

You will see:

- A `require` statement that checks a role before allowing an action.  
- Events that log role changes.

This is basic **on‑chain authorization**.  
For Flow engineers, it is important to ask:

- Who controlled the initial role assignments?  
- How can those roles change over time?

### 5. State Machine–Style Contracts

Some contracts model **state machines**. For example:

- A “workflow” with steps like `Created` → `Funded` → `Locked` → `Completed`.  
- Each function can only be called in a specific state.

Patterns:

- An explicit `state` variable that tracks where the contract is.  
- Guards at the start of functions that check the state.

This is a **safety pattern** that prevents invalid transitions and clarifies the system’s behavior.

### 6. Composable Contracts (Delegation, Hooks)

In real‑world protocols, contracts are rarely isolated.  
Common patterns:

- **Delegation** — one contract forwards calls to another.  
- **Hooks** — callback functions that let other contracts react to specific events.

These are how:

- Token contracts integrate with governance,  
- Oracles feed data into logic,  
- Or L2s coordinate with L1s.

Composability is powerful but increases complexity; you must reason about the whole graph.

## Why Patterns Matter for Security

Design patterns shape security:

- A token pattern that uses `transferFrom` and `allowance` must be careful about **reentrancy** and **malicious approvals**.  
- An upgradeable pattern that centralizes control introduces **single‑point‑of‑failure risk**.  
- A state‑machine pattern can prevent some bugs but can be bypassed if the state is not enforced correctly.

As an engineer, you should:

- Recognize the pattern first.  
- Then ask: “What are the canonical attacks on this pattern?”  
- And finally, “Does this specific instance handle them?”

You will not prevent all bugs, but you can avoid repeating well‑known mistakes.

## How This Fits Into the Flow Initiative

In Flow labs:

- You will see **ERC‑20‑style tokens** for internal use or examples.  
- You will see **modular contracts** that reuse logic.  
- You may see **upgradeable patterns** for experimentation, often with warnings.

Your job is:

- To read contracts and identify the patterns.  
- To tweak them to suit Flow‑specific use cases.  
- To document the assumptions and trade‑offs clearly.

In African‑centric contexts, this is especially important when:

- You are building trustless systems for communities.  
- Gas cost and upgradeability decisions directly affect users.  
- You must balance **security** and **accessibility**.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Identify Patterns in a Contract

Take a small contract from a Flow lab (or an example in docs):

- Write a short note identifying:  
  - Whether it looks like a token‑like pattern.  
  - Whether it uses modular or library‑style code.  
  - Whether it might be upgradeable or state‑machine‑style.

- For each pattern, write one sentence describing what it is responsible for.

### Exercise 2: Sketch a Simple Token Pattern

Without writing real Solidity/Vyper, sketch a **conceptual token pattern**:

- A mapping from addresses to balances.  
- Functions like `transfer` and `approve`.  
- Events like `Transfer` and `Approval`.

Diagram this as a **mental model**, not code.  
Then, list one potential security issue (e.g., overflow, approval misuse).

### Exercise 3: Relate to a Flow Use Case

Imagine a Flow system that:

- Issues tokens to trainees.  
- Lets them transfer tokens to each other.  
- Logs all transfers for transparency.

Design a small “contract blueprint” in markdown:

- What state do you store?  
- What functions do you expose?  
- What pattern names (e.g., ERC‑20, state machine, proxy) could apply?

This is a **high‑level design exercise** for the kind of contract you will write later.

## Self‑Assessment

Rate yourself from 1 to 5:

- I can recognize common contract patterns (tokens, modular, upgradeable, state machine).  
- I can explain what each pattern is trying to solve.  
- I can point to one security or limitation trade‑off per pattern.  
- I can connect patterns to real‑world Flow‑style use cases.

Action item: write a short note in your lab repo describing which pattern you would use for a “trainee‑reward token” and why.

## Next Steps

- Read the next lesson in the smart‑contracts track, such as `03-security-anti-patterns.md`, to see how common patterns can be misused.  
- Use this pattern vocabulary when you read or discuss other contracts.  
- Treat design patterns as **shared mental tools** that let you reason about on‑chain systems efficiently.
