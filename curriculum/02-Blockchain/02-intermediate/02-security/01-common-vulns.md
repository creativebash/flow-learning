# Common Vulnerabilities

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Recognize the most common smart‑contract vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, integer overflow, front‑running).  
- Map each vulnerability to the system properties it exploits (shared state, gas, visibility).  
- Use a “defensive mindset” when reading or writing contracts.  
- Avoid blindly copying patterns from the web without checking for known flaws.

## Introduction

Smart contracts are powerful because they are **public, persistent, and executable**.  
But this same power makes them a target for **very specific, very predictable** vulnerabilities.  

In the Flow Initiative, you will not be expected to discover new classes of bugs.  
You *are* expected to **avoid the common ones** and to **recognize them quickly** when you see them in code.

This lesson focuses on:

- High‑impact, well‑known vulnerabilities,  
- How they appear in real‑world contracts, and  
- Simple engineering rules you can follow in Flow‑style labs.

You will practice **reading for danger**, not just reading for correctness.

## What a “Vulnerability” Means Here

In blockchain systems, a **vulnerability** is a flaw that lets an attacker:

- Steal or block value,  
- Disrupt service, or  
- Extract information or control.

Unlike regular web apps, many of these flaws are **strictly deterministic** and **exploitable forever** once the contract is deployed.

So your goal is to **anticipate** and **prevent** them, not just react.

## Common Vulnerability Patterns

### 1. Reentrancy

**What it is:**  
A contract calls an external contract, and that external contract calls back into the original contract before the first call finishes.  
This can allow the attacker to:

- Drain balances multiple times,  
- Bypass checks, or  
- Lock up state.

**Why it happens:**  
- State is updated **after** external calls.  
- The attacker triggers the call, then re‑enters the same function.

**Defensive rule:**  
- Update state **before** making external calls (the **checks‑effects‑interactions** pattern).  
- In Flow‑style contracts, prefer simple, non‑reentrant designs.

### 2. Integer Overflow / Underflow

**What it is:**  
A number calculation grows beyond the maximum or minimum that the data type can hold.  
On older chains, this could wrap around silently, leading to:

- Fake balances,  
- Incorrect allowances, or  
- Unauthorized actions.

**Why it happens:**  
- Developers assume inputs are “reasonable.”  
- No explicit bounds checking.

**Defensive rule:**  
- Use **safe math libraries** or modern compilers that revert on overflow.  
- Sanitize inputs and never trust external numbers without checks.

### 3. Access‑Control Issues

**What it is:**  
Incorrect or missing access control lets unauthorized actors:

- Upgrade contracts,  
- Pause or unpause,  
- Mint or burn tokens, or  
- Change configuration.

**Why it happens:**  
- Owner or admin roles are too powerful.  
- No role‑based structure or too many privileged functions.

**Defensive rule:**  
- Grant the **minimum necessary privileges**.  
- Prefer **role‑based schemes** over single‑owner models.  
- Force multi‑party control for critical operations.

### 4. Gas‑Related Issues (Gas Limit, Denial of Service)

**What it is:**  
A contract’s gas cost can be **too high** or **too low**, depending on the vulnerability:

- **Gas limit exceeded**: the function cannot finish, so it reverts.  
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: an attacker forces the gas cost to be so high that the function is unusable.

**Why it happens:**  
- Operations that scale with user count (e.g., dynamic loops).  
- Unbounded external calls.

**Defensive rule:**  
- Avoid unbounded loops over user‑controlled data.  
- Chunk work into multiple transactions.  
- Profile gas usage under realistic load.

### 5. Front‑Running and MEV‑Like Patterns

**What it is:**  
An attacker sees a pending transaction and acts before it or in response to it, extracting value.  
This is common in:

- Auctions,  
- Marketplaces,  
- On‑chain games.

**Why it happens:**  
- Transactions are public in the mempool.  
- Timing matters more than in traditional systems.

**Defensive rule:**  
- Design flows that are **less sensitive to timing order** when possible.  
- Use commitments and reveals, or private order‑flow solutions where feasible.  
- As a first‑level, **assume transactions are public and inspectable**.

### 6. Uninitialized or Misconfigured State

**What it is:**  
A contract deploys with state that is:

- Not initialized correctly, or  
- Configured in a way that breaks assumptions.

This can lead to:

- Lost funds,  
- Disabled functions, or  
- Confusion about who owns what.

**Why it happens:**  
- Deployment scripts skip initialization steps.  
- Tests pass in a controlled environment but fail in production.

**Defensive rule:**  
- Write a clear **initialization plan** for the contract.  
- Test the **deploy‑init‑use** flow end‑to‑end.  
- Never assume default values are safe.

## Why These Patterns Matter for Flow Engineers

Flow Initiative trainees will work on:

- **Token‑style contracts** (balances, allowances),  
- **Upgradeable patterns**,  
- **State‑machine‑style systems**.

Each of these is fertile ground for the vulnerabilities above.

Your job is to:

- **Read** contracts with an eye for these patterns.  
- **Write** contracts that explicitly avoid the common traps.  
- **Document** the assumptions and limitations you’ve accepted.

In African‑centric contexts, this is especially important when:

- Contracts handle real‑world assets or incentives.  
- Communities must trust the system without a central watchdog.  
- Mistakes can have real‑life consequences.

## How to Practice “Reading for Danger”

When you open a contract (Flow lab or example):

1. **Check state**  
   - Where is the critical data (balances, ownership, configuration)?  
   - Is it updated before or after external calls?

2. **Check functions**  
   - Which functions are privileged?  
   - What are their gas costs?  
   - Do they loop over user‑controlled data?

3. **Check external calls**  
   - Where do they call outside contracts?  
   - Could those contracts call back into the same contract?

4. **Check deployment and init**  
   - How is the contract initialized?  
   - Who owns it?  
   - Can it be upgraded?

This is a **checklist mindset**, not a one‑off inspection.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Label a Vulnerable Snippet

Find a small, public‑domain example of a contract that has a known vulnerability (e.g., reentrancy or integer overflow):

- Identify the vulnerability and label it with its name.  
- Mark in the code where the risky pattern appears.  
- Write a short note describing how you would fix it at a high level.

Do not actually deploy anything; keep this in a notes file.

### Exercise 2: Sketch a “Safe Skeleton”

Sketch a simple contract “skeleton” that:

- Stores balances,  
- Has a `transfer` function,  
- And a privileged `pause` function.

Then, annotate:

- Where the vulnerable patterns could appear.  
- How you would avoid them (e.g., update state first, use safe math, restrict access).

This is a **design sketch**, not a full implementation.

### Exercise 3: Relate to a Flow Lab

Look at a Flow‑style blockchain lab that uses a contract:

- Identify one place where a common vulnerability *could* appear (e.g., unbounded loop, external call, missing access control).  
- Write a short note describing how you would change the design to make it safer.  
- If you feel confident, propose a small, concrete code change (even if you don’t run it).

## Self‑Assessment

Rate yourself from 1 to 5:

- I can name at least three common vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, overflow, access control).  
- I can explain how each one works in plain language.  
- I can see where they might appear in simple contracts.  
- I can list at least one defensive rule for each.

Action item: write a short note in your lab repo describing which vulnerability you find hardest to avoid and why.

## Next Steps

- Read the next lesson in the security track (e.g., `02-formal-checking-and-tools.md`) to see how tools can help automate some of this inspection.  
- Use this “vulnerability‑reading” habit every time you look at a new contract.  
- Treat security as a **continuous practice**, not a one‑time exam.
