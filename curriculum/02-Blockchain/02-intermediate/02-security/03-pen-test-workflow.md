# Penetration Testing Workflow

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Describe the core phases of a blockchain‑oriented penetration‑testing workflow.  
- Apply a simple pen‑test checklist to a Flow‑style contract or lab.  
- Use pen‑testing thinking to design more robust systems (not just “break them”).  
- Distinguish between **manual testing**, **automated tools**, and **real‑world engagements**.

## Introduction

**Penetration testing** (often called “pen testing”) is the practice of **ethically attacking** a system to find vulnerabilities before real attackers do.  
In blockchain, this usually means:

- Testing smart contracts,  
- Their surrounding infrastructure (nodes, wallets, APIs),  
- And the **economic and governance** rules that drive them.

For Flow Initiative trainees, you will not usually be hired as full‑time penetration testers.  
But you *will* benefit from learning a **pen‑tester‑style mindset** so you can:

- design systems that are harder to abuse,  
- spot exploitable patterns in labs, and  
- understand what “we tested this” actually means.

This lesson focuses on a **workflow** you can mentally apply to any Flow‑style contract or ecosystem.

## What Penetration Testing Is (and Isn’t)

Penetration testing is:

- A **structured, goal‑driven** process.  
- Conducted by people or tools that **simulate attackers**.  
- Done to **discover exploitable weaknesses**, not just theoretical bugs.

It is **not**:

- A one‑off quick scan.  
- Guaranteed to find every bug.  
- A replacement for good design, testing, or audits.

In blockchain, pen tests are especially valuable because:

- Bugs can be **irreversible** and **high‑value**.  
- Attackers are **highly motivated** and well‑funded.  
- Economic models can be exploited in subtle ways (e.g., governance manipulation, MEV‑style attacks).

## Core Phases of a Pen‑Test Workflow

Most blockchain‑oriented pen‑test workflows share a few high‑level stages:

### 1. Scope and Reconnaissance

Before you touch the code:

- **Define scope**:  
  - What contracts, networks, or components are in scope?  
  - What is absolutely out of scope (e.g., mainnet, real user funds)?  

- **Gather intel (recon)**:  
  - Identify public contracts and their addresses.  
  - Understand the ecosystem (tokens, oracles, governance, L2s).  
  - Collect public docs, ABI, and any known usage patterns.

In Flow‑style contexts, this usually means:

- Reading the lab instructions and context,  
- Mapping which contracts you are allowed to “attack,”  
- Confirming you are on a **local** or **testnet‑style** environment.

### 2. Manual Analysis and Threat Modeling

Next, you **think like an attacker**:

- **Threat‑modeling questions**:  
  - Who would want to attack this?  
  - What would they gain (money, governance power, disruption)?  
  - What are the “crown‑jewel” functions (e.g., minting, pausing, upgrading)?

- **Manual review**:  
  - Read the code for the same patterns you learned (`01-common-vulns.md`).  
  - Trace state changes and external calls.  
  - Map out the **attack surface** (what can you influence).

This is where your earlier lessons pay off:  
You already know to look for reentrancy, overflow, access‑control over‑privileges, and gas‑related DoS.

### 3. Automated Scanning

Now you bring in tools:

- **Static analysis** (e.g., Slither, Mythril) to flag common patterns.  
- **Security scanners** or IDE‑integrated analyzers that highlight potential issues.  

These tools help you:

- Find low‑hanging‑fruit bugs,  
- Spot things you missed in manual review,  
- Prioritize which functions to attack first.

But tools are not magic:

- They miss **novel** or **design‑level** bugs.  
- They can generate **false positives**.

So you treat their output as **input** for the next phase, not a final verdict.

### 4. Active Testing and Exploitation

In this phase, you **simulate an attack**:

- **Craft transactions** that exercise edge cases:  
  - High‑value transfers.  
  - Zero‑ or extreme‑value inputs.  
  - Strange call sequences (e.g., calling a function twice in a row, or in a specific order).

- **Try to exploit known vulnerability patterns**:  
  - Reentrancy: trigger a call that re‑enters before updating state.  
  - Overflow: push arithmetic beyond safe limits.  
  - Access‑control bypass: try calling admin‑only functions with a non‑admin account.

In Flow‑style labs, you should:

- Do this **only in local or testnet environments**.  
- Clearly distinguish between **learning** and **real‑world** engagements.

The goal is **understanding**, not causing real damage.

### 5. Reporting and Remediation

After you find issues:

- **Write a simple report**:  
  - What you tested.  
  - What vulnerabilities you found.  
  - How to reproduce them.  
  - Their **impact** (e.g., could drain funds).

- **Suggest fixes**:  
  - At a high level, what change would close the vulnerability.  
  - What design or pattern would reduce risk.

This is not a full‑professional‑style audit report.  
It is a **structured note** that helps the team improve.

### 6. Retesting

Finally:

- **Retest** the same scenarios after fixes are applied.  
- Confirm that the vulnerability is **truly gone**.

This closes the loop and shows that the fix is effective.

## Why This Matters for Flow Engineers

In Flow‑style labs:

- You will design and modify contracts that resemble real‑world systems.  
- You may later work on projects that **actually** pay money or govern communities.  
- You will read and write **security‑sensitive code**.

By learning a pen‑test‑style workflow, you:

- Develop **attack‑oriented thinking** that helps you **design safer systems**.  
- Understand what “we tested this” really means behind the scenes.  
- Gain confidence that you can **find and fix** real‑world‑like issues.

In African‑centric contexts, this is especially important when:

- Contracts handle real‑world assets or incentives.  
- Communities must trust the system without a central watchdog.  
- Mistakes can have real‑life consequences.

## How to Apply This in a Flow‑Style Lab

You do not need a full‑scale pen‑test every time.  
But you *can* apply the **mental workflow**:

1. **Scope**: Define what you are allowed to test and in which environment.  
2. **Recon**: Read the contract and ecosystem docs.  
3. **Manual review**: Apply your vulnerability checklist.  
4. **Automated scan**: Run a static analyzer if possible.  
5. **Active testing**: Craft transactions that probe edge cases.  
6. **Reporting**: Write a short note describing findings and suggested fixes.  
7. **Retest**: Confirm changes work.

This is a **lightweight pen‑testing practice** that fits Flow‑style exploration.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Sketch a Simple Pen‑Test

Take a small Flow‑style contract:

- Sketch a pen‑test workflow for it:  
  - Scope and recon.  
  - What to test.  
  - What tools to use.  
  - What to check.

Write this as a **mental model**, not code.

### Exercise 2: Build a Personal Checklist

Using what you learned in `01-common-vulns.md` and this lesson, build a **pen‑test checklist**:

- Write it as a markdown list.  
- Include at least 5 items.  
- For each item, add a short explanation.

Keep this in your lab repo and update it as you learn more.

### Exercise 3: Simulate an Attack

In a local or testnet environment:

- Attempt to exploit a known vulnerability (e.g., reentrancy) in a Flow‑style contract.  
- Document the steps and the outcome.  
- Note how you would fix it.

This is a **hands‑on⁠–in‑a‑safe‑environment** exercise.

## Self‑Assessment

Rate yourself from 1 to 5:

- I can list the main phases of a pen‑test workflow.  
- I can apply this workflow to a Flow‑style contract.  
- I can see how pen‑testing thinking helps design safer systems.  
- I can distinguish between learning and real‑world engagements.

Action item: write a short note in your lab repo describing one vulnerability you would test in a Flow‑style contract and how you would test it.

## Next Steps

- Read the next lesson in the security track (e.g., `04-security‑best‑practices.md`) to see how to integrate this workflow into daily practice.  
- Use this pen‑test‑style mindset every time you design or modify a contract.  
- Treat security as a **continuous process**, not a one‑time event.
