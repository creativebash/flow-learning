# Code Audit Practices

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Explain what a code audit is and why it matters in blockchain systems.  
- Follow a simple, repeatable process for reading and reviewing contracts.  
- Use checklists and heuristics to spot common issues.  
- Write useful, structured audit notes that help the team improve the code.

## Introduction

A **code audit** is a focused review of source code to find bugs, vulnerabilities, and design problems *before* deployment.  
In blockchain, audits are especially important because:

- Contracts are hard to change after they go live.  
- Bugs can lead to irreversible loss of value.  
- Security is not just a “nice‑to‑have”; it is a core part of the product.

In the Flow Initiative, you will not be expected to perform full‑blown, professional‑grade audits.  
You *are* expected to **read critically** and **ask the right questions** when you see a contract.

This lesson teaches you lightweight **audit‑style practices** that fit Flow‑style labs and onboarding work.

## What Is a Code Audit?

A code audit is:

- A **systematic inspection** of code.  
- Done by one or more reviewers.  
- Motivated by **risk**, not perfection.

In practice, an audit:

- Identifies **vulnerabilities**, defects, and anti‑patterns.  
- Documents **assumptions** and **edge cases**.  
- Makes **recommendations** for fixes or improvements.

For Flow engineers, the goal is **risk‑aware review**, not theoretical completeness.  
You do not need to prove the contract is “perfect”; you need to reduce the chance of catastrophic failure.

## Core Principles of Auditing

### 1. Assume the Code Can Be Misused

Treat every contract as if it will be:

- Called by honest and malicious actors.  
- Used in unexpected ways.  
- Interfaced with many other systems.

This is different from “assuming good faith” in normal software.  
Blockchains demand a **threat‑modeling mindset**.

### 2. Focus on High‑Impact Areas

Auditors usually prioritize:

- Functions that handle **value** (e.g., transfers, minting, burning).  
- Functions that control **access** (e.g., owner, admin, upgrade).  
- State‑changing functions that interact with **external contracts**.

You can copy this priority list in Flow labs:  
Spend more time on **value‑ and access‑sensitive** logic; less on read‑only helpers.

### 3. Use Checklists and Heuristics

Experienced auditors keep checklists for common issues such as:

- Reentrancy.  
- Integer overflow/underflow.  
- Access‑control flaws.  
- Gas‑related issues.  
- Misconfigured or uninitialized state.

Even if you do not have a professional checklist, you can **build your own** from the vulnerabilities you learned in `01-common-vulns.md`.

### 4. Review the Design, Not Just the Code

An audit is not just about syntax and style. It includes:

- The **contract design** (what it is trying to do).  
- The **business logic** (how it enforces rules).  
- The **dependencies** (what other contracts or libraries it uses).

This is where Flow‑style systems benefit: you can reason about **incentives, tokens, and L1/L2** impacts, not just code.

## How to Audit a Contract (Step‑by‑Step)

### Step 1: Understand the Purpose

Before reading a line of code, ask:

- What is this contract *for*?  
- What problem does it solve?  
- What assumptions does it make about the environment?

If the answer is unclear, write a short note that describes the **goal** and **scope**.  
This is the **audit context**.

### Step 2: Map the State

List the main state variables:

- Balances, ownership, configuration.  
- Who is allowed to read or write each piece?

Ask:

- Is this state well‑protected?  
- Are there any “dangerous” variables that can freeze or empty the contract?

Map these to the **vulnerability** patterns you know (e.g., overflow, access control).

### Step 3: Trace the Functions

For each function:

- Identify its **purpose** (e.g., transfer, pause, upgrade).  
- Check its **visibility** (public, external, internal, private).  
- Identify where it **reads or writes state**.  
- Mark where it **calls external contracts**.

At this stage, you are not just reading; you are **building a mental model** of the control‑flow.

### Step 4: Flag Risky Patterns

Use your checklist:

- **Reentrancy**: does state change after external calls?  
- **Overflow**: are there unchecked arithmetic operations?  
- **Access control**: who can call this? Is that reasonable?  
- **Gas**: are there loops over user‑controlled arrays?  
- **Initialization**: was the contract set up correctly?

For each pattern you see:

- Label it in your notes.  
- Write one sentence describing the risk.  
- Suggest a simple fix or workaround.

### Step 5: Write Audit Notes

A good audit note includes:

- The **file and line** being referenced.  
- A **short description** of the issue.  
- An **impact** statement (e.g., “could allow unauthorized minting”).  
- A **recommended action** (e.g., “move state update before the call”).

You do not need to prove every claim formally. You *do* need to be **clear and actionable**.

## Lightweight Audit Checklist for Flow Labs

You can use this as a template when reviewing any Flow‑style contract:

- Is the **state layout** clear and protected?  
- Are **value‑handling** functions safe from overflow and reentrancy?  
- Are **privileged functions** restricted to the right roles?  
- Are **gas‑hungry** operations bounded or chunked?  
- Is the **initialization** obvious and tested?  
- Are **external calls** minimized and well‑documented?

Score each item 1–5, and write a brief comment where you score low.

## How This Fits Into the Flow Initiative

In Flow labs:

- You will review and modify contracts written by others.  
- You will write your own simple contracts.  
- You may also join **peer‑review** sessions.

Your audit‑style mindset helps:

- Catch issues before they are deployed.  
- Improve the **quality and safety** of the codebase.  
- Develop a **shared understanding** of what “safe” means in your context.

In African‑centric contexts, this is especially important when:

- Contracts handle real‑world assets or incentives.  
- Communities must trust the system without a central authority.  
- Mistakes can have significant real‑life consequences.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Perform a Mini‑Audit

Take a small contract from a Flow lab:

- Follow the five‑step audit process above.  
- Write a short audit note (no more than one page) describing:  
  - What the contract is for.  
  - What state it stores.  
  - What risky patterns you see.  
  - What you would change.

This is a **real‑world‑style exercise**, even if you never deploy it.

### Exercise 2: Build a Personal Checklist

Using what you learned in `01-common-vulns.md` and this lesson, build a **personal auditing checklist**:

- Write it as a markdown list.  
- Include at least 5 items.  
- For each item, add a short explanation.

Keep this in your lab repo and update it as you learn more.

### Exercise 3: Peer Review

If you are in a cohort or community:

- Trade contracts with a peer.  
- Each of you audits the other’s code using the checklist.  
- Share your notes and discuss.

This is how you build **collaborative security culture**.

## Self‑Assessment

Rate yourself from 1 to 5:

- I can explain what a code audit is.  
- I can follow a simple step‑by‑step process to review a contract.  
- I can use a checklist to spot common issues.  
- I can write useful audit notes.

Action item: write a short note in your lab repo describing one risk you would flag in a Flow‑style contract and how you would reduce it.

## Next Steps

- Read the next lesson in the security track (e.g., `03-formal-checking-and-tools.md`) to see how tools can help automate parts of auditing.  
- Use this audit‑style practice every time you open a contract.  
- Treat security as a **team sport**, not an individual skill.
