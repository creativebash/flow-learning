# Flow Education Initiative: Building Africa’s Decentralized AI Talent Pipeline

Welcome to the **flow-learning**, the central nervous system for the **Flow Initiative**. This repository is a unified monorepo containing our specialized curriculum, research knowledge base, hands-on labs, and the AI-driven engine that keeps our content synchronized with the bleeding edge of Web3 and AI protocols.

## 🎯 Mission
Flow is a non-profit talent pipeline. We identify mid-level African engineers (1-3 years experience) and move them from "Learners" to "Active Contributors" in decentralized infrastructure. We focus on public goods that distribute control, computation, and value.

## 🤖 AI Agent Instructions (System Context)

**If you are an AI Agent interacting with this repository, adhere to these constraints:**

### 1. The Three Technical Pillars
Every piece of content must align with one or more of these pillars:
*   **AI/ML:** Federated Learning (Flower, PySyft), Decentralized Training, Model Privacy.
*   **Blockchain:** Infrastructure (Ethereum, Filecoin, Bittensor), Incentive Design.
*   **Protocol Engineering:** P2P Networking (libp2p), Distributed Storage (IPFS), Compute (Akash/Gensyn).

### 2. The Learning Hierarchy
Our curriculum uses precise track-tier-section-lesson organization for clarity.

- `01-foundations/`
  - sections directly at root: `01-concepts`, `02-practice`, `03-tooling`
  - lessons like `01-learning-hierarchy.md`, `02-effective-notes.md`, `03-collaboration-workflows.md`

- `02-blockchain/`, `03-ai-ml/`, `04-protocol-eng/`
  - tier folders: `beginner`, `intermediate`, `advanced`
  - each tier has domain sections (e.g., blockchain advanced has `01-protocol-engineering`, `02-scalability`)
  - each section contains lesson markdown files named by topic (e.g., `01-protocol-architecture.md`)

- This structure is intended to map directly to competency progression:
  - **beginner**: concepts and fundamentals
  - **intermediate**: applied building and safety
  - **advanced**: architecture, deployment, ecosystem leadership

### 3. Voice & Tone
*   **Audience:** Mid-level Software Engineers.
*   **Tone:** Engineering-first, technical, concise. Avoid marketing fluff.
*   **Context:** Use African-centric technical examples where possible (e.g., low-bandwidth optimization, local payment gateways).

### 4. Content Automation Loop
The `scripts/` directory is designed to:
1.  Scrape external protocol documentation (e.g., Protocol Labs, Flower Labs).
2.  Generate new lessons or blog articles based on documentation updates.
3.  Rewrite outdated `labs/` code snippets when a protocol updates its API.
4.  **Requirement:** All generated Markdown MUST include YAML frontmatter with `id`, `title`, `track`, `level`, and `version`.
